Limited data exist on chemotherapy-associated subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk."", ""SMNs occurring > 5 years from diagnosis, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, were evaluated in survivors diagnosed when they were < 21 years old, from 1970 to 1999 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age at diagnosis, 7.0 years; median age at last follow-up, 31.8 years). Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by treatment: chemotherapy-only (n = 7,448), chemotherapy plus radiation (n = 10,485), radiation only (n = 2,063), or neither (n = 2,158). Multivariable models were used to assess chemotherapy-associated SMN risk, including dose-response relationships."", ""Of 1,498 SMNs among 1,344 survivors, 229 occurred among 206 survivors treated with chemotherapy only. Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence was 3.9%, 9.0%, 10.8%, and 3.4% for the chemotherapy-only, chemotherapy plus radiation, radiation-only, or neither-treatment groups, respectively. Chemotherapy-only survivors had a 2.8-fold increased SMN risk compared with the general population (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2), with SIRs increased for subsequent leukemia/lymphoma (1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), breast cancer (4.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 6.0), soft-tissue sarcoma (3.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7), thyroid cancer (3.8; 95% CI, 2.7 to 5.1), and melanoma (2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). SMN rate was associated with > 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> platinum (relative rate [RR] 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5), and a dose response was observed between alkylating agents and SMN rate (RR, 1.2/5,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). A linear dose response was also demonstrated between anthracyclines and breast cancer rate (RR, 1.3/100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6)."", ""Childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy only, particularly higher cumulative doses of platinum and alkylating agents, face increased SMN risk. Linear dose responses were seen between alkylating agents and SMN rates and between anthracyclines and breast cancer rates. Limiting cumulative doses and consideration of alternate chemotherapies may reduce SMN risk.",Cancer

Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs.

27683180,"<b>Purpose:</b> Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline <i>TP53</i> variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline <i>TP53</i> in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.<b>Results:</b> WES revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic <i>TP53-</i>mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of <i>TP53-</i>coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline <i>TP53</i> variant.<b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, germline <i>TP53</i> is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline <i>TP53</i> variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. \u00a92016 AACR</i>.",Cancer

31059116,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Its high mortality rate results from lack of adequate and sensitive methods allowing for the detection of the early stages of the disease, as well as low efficiency of the treatment, caused by the cytotoxic drug resistance of cancer cells. Unfortunately, tumours are able to develop new pathways and protective mechanisms that allow them to survive toxic conditions of chemotherapy. Therefore, intensive search for new genes and proteins involved in resistance to cytotoxic drugs is still needed, especially from a clinical point of view. The article presents an overview of the available literature on the role of semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), protocadherin 9 (PCDH9), and S100 calcium binding protein A3 (S100A3) in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance of various tumors including ovarian cancer. As it turns out, the role of described genes/proteins is not limited only to their native biological activity but they function also as an oncogenic or suppressor factors in the tumor development. Moreover, they can also play an important role in development of drug resistance, as it was shown in ovarian cancer cell lines.",Cancer

The current review identified 113 published articles that assessed PN and cancer care, between August 1, 2010, and February 1, 2018, 14 of which reported on the cost-effectiveness of PN programs. Most publications focused on the effectiveness of PN in screening (50%) and diagnosis (27%) along the continuum of cancer care. Many described the effectiveness of PN for breast cancer (52%) or colorectal cancer outcomes (51%). Most studies reported favorable outcomes for PN programs, including increased uptake of and adherence to cancer screenings, timely diagnostic resolution and follow-up, higher completion rates for cancer therapy, and higher rates of attending medical appointments. Cost-effectiveness studies showed that PN programs yielded financial benefits. Quality assessment showed that 75 of the 113 included articles (65%) had 2 or more weak components. In conclusion, this review indicates numerous gaps within the PN and cancer literature where improvement is needed. For example, more research is needed at other points along the continuum of cancer care outside of screening and diagnosis.

One such method is the mainstream consent pathway, whereby a member of the oncology team (rather than a genetic specialist) is responsible for counseling, consenting, and arranging genetic testing for cancer patients. We systematically reviewed the literature for evidence evaluating mainstream pathways for patients with breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Article references were checked for additional studies. Trial databases were searched for ongoing studies. Of the 13 papers that met inclusion criteria, 11 individual study groups were identified (two study groups had two publications each). Ten of the 11 studies evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of BRCA testing for patients and/or clinicians in different clinical settings in breast and ovarian cancer, while the final study explored the attitudes of colorectal specialists toward genetic testing for colorectal cancer. None involved prostate cancer. Overall, mainstream pathways were acceptable and feasible. Medical oncologist- and nurse-driven pathways were particularly successful, with both patients and clinicians satisfied with this process. Although the content of pretest counseling was less consistent compared with counseling via the traditional model, patients were largely satisfied with the education they received.

28530852,"Purpose Childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) are at increased risk for subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We evaluated the long-term risk of SMNs in a well-characterized cohort of 5-year CCSs, with a particular focus on individual chemotherapeutic agents and solid cancer risk. Methods The Dutch Childhood Cancer Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer cohort includes 6,165 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 in the Netherlands. SMNs were identified by linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry, the Dutch Pathology Registry, and medical chart review. We calculated standardized incidence ratios, excess absolute risks, and cumulative incidences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate treatment-associated risks for breast cancer, sarcoma, and all solid cancers. Results After a median follow-up of 20.7 years (range, 5.0 to 49.8 years) since first diagnosis, 291 SMNs were ascertained in 261 CCSs (standardized incidence ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.6 to 5.8; excess absolute risk, 20.3/10,000 person-years). Cumulative SMN incidence at 25 years after first diagnosis was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4% to 4.6%) and did not change noticeably among CCSs treated in the 1990s compared with those treated earlier. We found dose-dependent doxorubicin-related increased risks of all solid cancers ( P<sub>trend</sub> < .001) and breast cancer ( P<sub>trend</sub> < .001). The doxorubicin-breast cancer dose response was stronger in survivors of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated childhood cancers (leukemia, CNS, and non-Ewing sarcoma) versus survivors of other cancers ( P<sub>difference</sub> = .008). In addition, cyclophosphamide was found to increase sarcoma risk in a dose-dependent manner ( P<sub>trend</sub> = .01). Conclusion The results strongly suggest that doxorubicin exposure in CCSs increases the risk of subsequent solid cancers and breast cancer, whereas cyclophosphamide exposure increases the risk of subsequent sarcomas. These results may inform future childhood cancer treatment protocols and SMN surveillance guidelines for CCSs.",Cancer

31481499,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a complex oncogenic symbiont. The molecular mechanisms governing EBV carcinogenesis remain elusive and the functional interactions between virus and host cells are incompletely defined. Here we present a comprehensive map of the host cell-pathogen interactome in EBV-associated cancers. We systematically analyzed RNA sequencing from >1,000 patients with 15 different cancer types, comparing virus and host factors of EBV<sup>+</sup> to EBV<sup>-</sup> tissues. EBV preferentially integrated at highly accessible regions of the cancer genome, with significant enrichment in super-enhancer architecture. Twelve EBV transcripts, including LMP1 and LMP2, correlated inversely with EBV reactivation signature. Overexpression of these genes significantly suppressed viral reactivation, consistent with a \""virostatic\"" function. In cancer samples, hundreds of novel frequent missense and nonsense variations in virostatic genes were identified, and variant genes failed to regulate their viral and cellular targets in cancer. For example, one-third of patients with EBV<sup>+</sup> NK/T-cell lymphoma carried two novel nonsense variants (Q322X, G342X) of <i>LMP1</i> and both variant proteins failed to restrict viral reactivation, confirming loss of virostatic function. Host cell transcriptional changes in response to EBV infection classified tumors into two molecular subtypes based on patterns of IFN signature genes and immune checkpoint markers, such as PD-L1 and IDO1. Overall, these findings uncover novel points of interaction between a common oncovirus and the human genome and identify novel regulatory nodes and druggable targets for individualized EBV and cancer-specific therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive map of the host cell-pathogen interactome in EBV<sup>+</sup> malignancies.<i>See related commentary by Mbulaiteye and Prokunina-Olsson, p. 5917</i>.",Cancer

33328623,"We monitored the burden of cancer in Italy and its trends over the last three decades, providing estimates of cancer incidence, mortality, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), for cancer overall and 30 cancer sites using data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017. An overview of mortality trends between 1990 and 2017 was also provided. In 2017, there were 254,336 new cancer cases in men and 214,994 in women, corresponding to an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 438 and 330/100,000, respectively. Between 1990 and 2017, incident cancer cases, and, to a lesser extent, ASIRs significantly increased overall and for almost all cancer sites, but ASIRs significantly declined for lung and other tobacco-related neoplasms. In 2017, there were 101,659 cancer deaths in men (age-standardized death rate, ASDR, 158.5/100,000) and 78,918 in women (ASDR 93.9/100,000). Cancer deaths significantly increased between 1990 and 2017 (+\u200918%), but ASDR significantly decreased (-\u200928%). Deaths significantly increased for many cancer sites, but decreased for stomach, esophageal, laryngeal, Hodgkin lymphoma, and testicular cancer. ASDRs significantly decreased for most neoplasms, with the main exceptions of cancer of the pancreas and uterus, and multiple myeloma. In 2017, cancer caused 3,204,000 DALYs. Between 1990 and 2017, DALYs and age-standardized DALY rates significantly declined (-3.4% and -33%, respectively). Age-standardized mortality rates in Italy showed favorable patterns over the last few decades. However, the absolute number of cancer cases and, to a lower extent, of cancer deaths increased likely due to the progressive ageing of the population, this calling for a continuous effort in cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment.",Cancer

33355181,"Cancer-associated cachexia, characterized by muscle wasting, is a lethal metabolic syndrome without defined etiology or established treatment. We previously found that p300 mediates cancer-induced muscle wasting by activating C/EBP\u03b2, which then upregulates key catabolic genes. However, the signaling mechanism that activates p300 in response to cancer is unknown. Here, we show that upon cancer-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 in skeletal muscle, p38\u03b2 MAPK phosphorylates Ser-12 on p300 to stimulate C/EBP\u03b2 acetylation, which is necessary and sufficient to cause muscle wasting. Thus, p38\u03b2 MAPK is a central mediator and therapeutic target of cancer-induced muscle wasting. In addition, nilotinib, an FDA-approved kinase inhibitor that preferentially binds p38\u03b2 MAPK, inhibited p300 activation 20-fold more potently than the p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, and abrogated cancer cell-induced muscle protein loss in C2C12 myotubes without suppressing p38\u03b1 MAPK-dependent myogenesis. Systemic administration of nilotinib at a low dose (0.5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in tumor-bearing mice not only alleviated muscle wasting, but also prolonged survival. Therefore, nilotinib appears to be a promising treatment for human cancer cachexia due to its selective inhibition of p38\u03b2 MAPK.

32753728,"The international American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system provides the current guidelines for the classification of cancer. However, among patients within the same stage, the clinical outcome can be very different. More recently, a novel definition of cancer has emerged, implicating at all stages a complex and dynamic interaction between tumour cells and the immune system. This has enabled the definition of the immune contexture, representing the pre-existing immune parameters associated with patient survival. Even so, the role of distinct immune cell types in modulating cancer progression is increasingly emerging. An immune-based assay named the 'Immunoscore' was defined to quantify the in situ T cell infiltrate and was demonstrated to be superior to the AJCC/UICC TNM classification for patients with colorectal cancer. This Review provides a broad overview of the main immune parameters positively or negatively shaping cancer development, including the Immunoscore, and their prognostic and predictive value. The importance of the immune system in cancer control is demonstrated by the requirement for a pre-existing intratumour adaptive immune response for effective immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors.

32157087,"Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cell metabolism can be regulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), but the mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we show that CAFs regulate malignant cell metabolism through pathways under the control of FAK. In breast and pancreatic cancer patients we find that low FAK expression, specifically in the stromal compartment, predicts reduced overall survival. In mice, depletion of FAK in a subpopulation of CAFs regulates paracrine signals that increase malignant cell glycolysis and tumour growth. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis in our mouse model identifies metabolic alterations which are reflected at the transcriptomic level in patients with low stromal FAK. Mechanistically we demonstrate that FAK-depletion in CAFs increases chemokine production, which via CCR1/CCR2 on cancer cells, activate protein kinase A, leading to enhanced malignant cell glycolysis. Our data uncover mechanisms whereby stromal fibroblasts regulate cancer cell metabolism independent of genetic mutations in cancer cells.",Cancer

33395982,"Defining a signature of cortical regions of interest preferentially affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology may offer improved sensitivity to early AD compared to hippocampal volume or mesial temporal lobe alone. Since late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) participants tend to have age-related comorbidities, the younger-onset age in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) may provide a more idealized model of cortical thinning in AD. To test this, the goals of this study were to compare the degree of overlap between the ADAD and LOAD cortical thinning maps and to evaluate the ability of the ADAD cortical signature regions to predict early pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals. We defined and analyzed the LOAD cortical maps of cortical thickness in 588 participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) and the ADAD cortical maps in 269 participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study. Both cohorts were divided into three groups: cognitively normal controls (n<sub>ADRC</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0381; n<sub>DIAN</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0145), preclinical (n<sub>ADRC</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0153; n<sub>DIAN</sub>\u00a0=\u00a076), and cognitively impaired (n<sub>ADRC</sub>\u00a0=\u00a054; n<sub>DIAN</sub>\u00a0=\u00a048). Both cohorts underwent clinical assessments, 3T MRI, and amyloid PET imaging with either <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh compound B or <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir. To generate cortical signature maps of cortical thickness, we performed a vertex-wise analysis between the cognitively normal controls and impaired groups within each cohort using six increasingly conservative statistical thresholds to determine significance. The optimal cortical map among the six statistical thresholds was determined from a receiver operating characteristic analysis testing the performance of each map in discriminating between the cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups. We then performed within-cohort and cross-cohort (e.g. ADAD maps evaluated in the Knight ADRC cohort) analyses to examine the sensitivity of the optimal cortical signature maps to the amyloid levels using only the cognitively normal individuals (cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups) in comparison to hippocampal volume. We found the optimal cortical signature maps were sensitive to early increases in amyloid for the asymptomatic individuals within their respective cohorts and were significant beyond the inclusion of hippocampus volume, but the cortical signature maps performed poorly when analyzing across cohorts. These results suggest the cortical signature maps are a useful MRI biomarker of early AD-related neurodegeneration in preclinical individuals and the pattern of decline differs between LOAD and ADAD.",Alzheimers Disease

31521394,"Observational epidemiological studies provide valuable information regarding naturally occurring protective factors observed in populations with very low prevalences of vascular disease. Between 1935 and 1965, the Italian-American inhabitants of Roseto (Pennsylvania, USA) observed a traditional Italian diet and maintained half the mortality rates from myocardial infarction compared with neighboring cities. In the Seven Countries Study, during 40years (1960-2000) Crete maintained the lowest overall mortality rates and coronary heart disease fatalities, which was attributed to strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet. In the French Three-City Study, a ten-year follow-up (2000-2010) showed that higher consumption of olive oil was associated with lower risk of death, as well as protection from cognitive decline and stroke. A large number of population-based studies and intervention trials have demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of vascular disease, obesity, arthritis, cancer, and age-associated cognitive decline. Many of these effects are the result of consumption of fruits, seeds, legumes and vegetables but olive oil is the chief dietary fat in Mediterranean countries and the main source of monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as an important source of beneficial polyphenols and other antioxidants. Considering the critical role of vascular factors in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer disease it seems appropriate to focus on disease modification through proven dietary therapy. The authors base their hypothesis on meta-analyses of epidemiological data, numerous experimental studies, and a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of action of extra-virgin olive oil and its components in the prevention of vascular disease. In addition, extra-virgin olive oil has had positive effects on experimental animal models of Alzheimer disease. We therefore propose that extra-virgin olive oil is a promising tool for mitigating the effects of adverse vascular factors and may be utilized for potential prevention of late-onset Alzheimer disease.",Alzheimers Disease

This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial assessed whether antihypertensive treatment increases the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Alzheimer disease. Methods and Results Four hundred seventy-seven patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease were randomized to the calcium-channel blocker nilvadipine 8\u00a0mg/day or placebo for 78\u00a0weeks. Presence of OH (blood pressure drop \u226520/\u226510\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg after 1 minute of standing) and OH-related adverse events (dizziness, syncope, falls, and fractures) was determined at 7 follow-up visits. Mean age of the study population was 72.2\u00b18.2\u00a0years and mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 20.4\u00b13.8. Baseline blood pressure was 137.8\u00b114.0/77.0\u00b18.6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Grade I hypertension was present in 53.4% (n=255). After 13\u00a0weeks, blood pressure had fallen by -7.8/-3.9\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg for nilvadipine and by -0.4/-0.8\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg for placebo ( P<0.001). Across the 78-week intervention period, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients with OH at a study visit (odds ratio [95% CI]=1.1 [0.8-1.5], P=0.62), nor in the proportion of visits where a patient met criteria for OH, corrected for number of visits (7.7\u00b113.8% versus 7.3\u00b111.6%).

AT4Rs (angiotensin IV receptors) have been associated with angiotensin receptor blockers' cognitive, cerebrovascular, and neuroinflammatory rescue in Alzheimer disease models. Yet, whether AT4Rs act alone or with AT2Rs remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether AT2Rs contribute to losartan's benefits and whether chronic AT2R activation could mimic angiotensin receptor blocker benefits in transgenic mice overexpressing familial Alzheimer disease mutations of the human APP (amyloid precursor protein). Losartan-treated mice (10 mg/kg per day, drinking water, 7 months) received intracerebroventricular (1 month) administration of vehicle or AT2R antagonist PD123319 (1.6 nmol/day). PD123319 countered losartan's benefits on spatial learning and memory, neurovascular coupling, and hampered those on oxidative stress and nitric oxide bioavailability. PD123319 did not oppose losartan's benefits on short-term memory and vasodilatory function and had no benefit on neuroinflammation or A\u03b2 (amyloid \u03b2) pathology. Mice receiving either vehicle or selective AT2R agonist compound 21 (intracerebroventricular: 1 nmol/day, 1 month or drinking water: 10 mg/kg per day, 7 months), showed no improvement in memory, vasodilatory function, or nitric oxide bioavailability.

Results- Genetically predicted 1-SD log-transformed increase in Lp(a) concentrations was associated with a substantial increase in risk of large artery stroke (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.30; <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduce in risk of small vessel stroke (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.97; <i>P</i>=0.001) and Alzheimer disease (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97; <i>P</i><0.001) using inverse-variance weighted method. No significant association was observed for total ischemic stroke or cardioembolic stroke. MR-Egger indicated no evidence of pleiotropic bias. Results were broadly consistent in sensitivity analyses using penalized inverse-variance weighted, simple median, weighted median, and MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier approaches accounting for potential genetic pleiotropy or outliers. Conclusions- This study provides evidence to support that high Lp(a) concentrations was causally associated with an increased risk of large artery stroke but a decreased risk of small vessel stroke and Alzheimer disease. The mechanism underlying the double-edged sword effect of Lp(a) concentrations on neurological system requires further investigation.",Alzheimers Disease

Using a cell model, we show that inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation function reduces neuronal differentiation. Linking these processes to pyrimidine nucleotides, uridine treatment recovers neuronal differentiation. To unmask the importance of these pathways in Alzheimer disease, we firstly confirm the existence of the <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in adult human brain.

33429401,"Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a heterogenous disorder with various pathobiological subtypes. In addition to the 4 major subtypes based on the distribution of tau pathology and brain atrophy (typical, limbic predominant, hippocampal sparing, and minimal atrophy [MA]), several other clinical variants showing distinct regional patterns of tau burden have been identified: nonamnestic, corticobasal syndromal, primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy, behavioral/dysexecutive, and mild dementia variants. Among the subtypes, differences were found in age at onset, sex distribution, cognitive status, disease duration, APOE genotype, and biomarker levels. The patterns of key network destructions parallel the tau and atrophy patterns of the AD subgroups essentially. Interruption of key networks, in particular the default-mode network that is responsible for cognitive decline, is consistent in hetero-genous AD groups. AD pathology is often associated with co-pathologies: cerebrovascular lesions, Lewy pathology, and TDP-43 proteinopathies. These mixed pathologies essentially influence the clinical picture of AD and may accel-erate disease progression.

33190798,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have recently emerged as key players in Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathogenesis, but their roles in AD remain largely elusive and require further investigation. Microglia functions are readily altered when isolated from their brain environment, and microglia reporter mice thus represent valuable tools to study the contribution of these cells to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. The CX3CR1<sup>+/eGFP</sup> mice is one of the most popular microglia reporter mice, and has been used in numerous studies to investigate in vivo microglial functions, including in the context of AD research. However, until now, the impact of CX3CR1 haplodeficiency on the typical features of Alzheimer Disease has not been studied in depth. To fill this gap, we generated APP<sup>swe</sup>/PSEN1<sup>dE9</sup>:CX3CR1<sup>+/eGFP</sup> mice and analyzed these mice for Alzheimer's like pathology and neuroinflammation hallmarks. More specifically, using robust multifactorial statistical and multivariate analyses, we investigated the impact of CX3CR1 deficiency in both males and females, at three typical stages of the pathology progression: at early stage when Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition just starts, at intermediate stage during A\u03b2 accumulation phase and at more advanced stages when A\u03b2 plaque number stabilizes. We found that CX3CR1 haplodeficiency had little impact on the progression of the pathology in the APP<sup>swe</sup>/PSEN1<sup>dE9</sup> model and demonstrated that the APP<sup>swe</sup>/PSEN1<sup>dE9</sup>:CX3CR1<sup>+/eGFP</sup> line is a relevant and useful model to study the role of microglia in Alzheimer Disease.

Alzheimer disease has consistently been the dominant form of SCU. This study explored the extent to which chain affiliation, which is common among NHs, affected SCU bed designation. Using data from the Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) from 1996 through 2010 with 207 431 NH-year observations, we described trends and compared chain-affiliated NHs with independent NHs. Designation of beds for Alzheimer disease SCUs grew from 1996 to 2003 and then declined. At the peak, 19.6% of all NHs had at least one Alzheimer disease SCU bed. In general, chain affiliation promoted Alzheimer disease SCU bed designation across time, chain size, and NH profit status. During the period of largest growth from 1996 to 2003, the likelihood of designation of Alzheimer disease SCU beds was 1.55 percentage points higher among for-profit NHs affiliated with large chains than independent for-profit NHs ( P < .001) and remained 1.28 percentage points higher from 2004 to 2010. However, chain-affiliated NHs generally had a lower percentage of residents with dementia than independent NHs. For example, although for-profit NHs affiliated with large chains had more Alzheimer disease SCU beds, they had nearly 3% fewer residents with dementia than independent NHs ( P < .001). We conclude that organizational decisions to designate beds for Alzheimer disease SCUs may be related to marketing strategies to attract residents since adoption of Alzheimer disease SCUs has fluctuated over time, but did not appear driven by demand.",Alzheimers Disease

30892128,"PSEN2 (presenilin 2) is one of the 3 proteins that, when mutated, causes early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) cases. In addition to its well-known role within the \u03b3-secretase complex (the enzyme ultimately responsible for A\u03b2 peptides formation), PSEN2 is endowed with some \u03b3-secretase-independent functions in distinct cell signaling pathways, such as the modulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Here, by using different FAD-PSEN2 cell models, we demonstrate that mutated PSEN2 impairs autophagy by causing a block in the degradative flux at the level of the autophagosome-lysosome fusion step. The defect does not depend on an altered lysosomal functionality but rather on a decreased recruitment of the small GTPase RAB7 to autophagosomes, a key event for normal autophagy progression. Importantly, FAD-PSEN2 action on autophagy is unrelated to its \u03b3-secretase activity but depends on its previously reported ability to partially deplete ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, thus reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response upon IP3-linked cell stimulations. Our data sustain the pivotal role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in autophagy and reveal a novel mechanism by which FAD-linked presenilins alter the degradative process, reinforcing the view of a causative role for a dysfunctional quality control pathway in AD neurodegeneration.<b>Abbreviations:</b> A\u03b2: amyloid \u03b2; AD: Alzheimer disease; ACTB: actin beta; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; APP: amyloid-beta precursor protein; BafA: bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>; BAPTA-AM: 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; CFP: cyan fluorescent protein; EGTA-AM: ethylene glycol-bis(\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; EGFP-HDQ74: enhanced GFP-huntingtin exon 1 containing 74 polyglutamine repeats; FAD: familial Alzheimer disease; FCS: fetal calf serum; FRET: fluorescence/F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer; GFP: green fluorescent protein; IP3: inositol trisphosphate; KD: knockdown; LAMP1: lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; MAP1LC3-II/LC3-II: lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MCU: mitochondrial calcium uniporter; MICU1: mitochondrial calcium uptake 1; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; MFN2: mitofusin 2; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; SQSTM1/p62: sequestosome 1; PSEN1: presenilin 1; PSEN2: presenilin 2; RAB7: RAB7A: member RAS oncogene family; RFP: red fluorescent protein; ATP2A/SERCA: ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporting; siRNA: small interference RNA; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase; WT: wild type.",Alzheimers Disease

Other similarities with prions include the ability to manifest as polymorphic and polyfunctional strains, resistance to chemical and enzymatic destruction, and the ability to spread within the brain and from the periphery to the brain.

32171592,"In Alzheimer disease (AD), astrocytes undergo complex changes and become reactive. The consequences of this reaction are still unclear. To evaluate the net impact of reactive astrocytes in AD, we developed viral vectors targeting astrocytes that either activate or inhibit the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2-STAT3) pathway, a central cascade controlling astrocyte reaction. We aimed to evaluate whether reactive astrocytes contribute to tau as well as amyloid pathologies in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice, an AD model that develops tau hyper-phosphorylation and amyloid deposition. JAK2-STAT3 pathway-mediated modulation of reactive astrocytes in 25% of the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice did not significantly influence tau phosphorylation or amyloid processing and deposition at early, advanced, and terminal disease stage. Interestingly, inhibition of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in hippocampal astrocytes did not improve spatial memory in the Y maze but it did reduce anxiety in the elevated plus maze. Our unique approach to specifically manipulate reactive astrocytes in situ show they may impact behavioral outcomes without influencing tau or amyloid pathology.",Alzheimers Disease
30338482,"Over the past three decades, there has been constant postulation regarding the infectious etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), which in turn suggests the vital role of various infectious agents in AD-associated inflammatory pathways. Recent findings indicate anti-microbial properties of A\u03b2, and suggest that A\u03b2 production and deposition in AD might be induced by infectious agents. Several types of spirochetes have been associated to dementia, cortical atrophy, and pathological and biological hallmarks of AD. A significant association between AD spirochetes and other pathogens like HSV-1 and Chlamydia pneumonia has now become well established. In neurons infected by HSV-1 showed A\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation. The expression of pro-inflammatory molecules have been found to be enhanced by specific bacterial ligands, and viral and bacterial DNA and RNA, thus activating the immune system. A\u03b2 has now been established as anti-microbial peptide capable of inducing pore formation, thus justifying their infection-mediated accumulation. Thus, a proper combination of anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and antibiotic therapeutics might potentially prevent the progression of AD.

30140051,"Alzheimer disease is more than a pure proteopathy. Chronic neuroinflammation stands out during the pathogenesis of the disease and in turn modulates disease progression. The central nervous system (CNS) is separated from the blood circulation by the blood-brain barrier.

A companion article provides a comprehensive review of extra-virgin olive oil. The benefits of consumption of long-chain \u03c9-3 fatty acids are described. Fresh fish provides eicosapentaenoic acid while \u03b1-linolenic acid is found in canola and soybean oils, purslane and nuts. These \u03c9-3 fatty acids interact metabolically with \u03c9-6 fatty acids mainly linoleic acid from corn oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil. Diets rich in \u03c9-6 fatty acids inhibit the formation of healthier \u03c9-3 fatty acids. The deleterious effects on lipid metabolism of excessive intake of carbohydrates, in particular high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners, are explained. The critical role of the \u03c9-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid in the developing and aging brain and in Alzheimer disease is addressed. Nutritional epidemiology studies, prospective population-based surveys, and clinical trials confirm the salutary effects of fish consumption on prevention of coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. Recent recommendations on fish consumption by pregnant women and potential mercury toxicity are reviewed. The polyphenols and flavonoids of plant origin play a critical role in the Mediterranean diet, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of benefit in type-2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer prevention. Polyphenols from fruits and vegetables modulate tau hyperphosphorylation and beta amyloid aggregation in animal models of Alzheimer disease.

31906949,"Alzheimer disease (AD) accounts for 60-70% of dementia cases. Given the seriousness of the disease and continual increase in patient numbers, developing effective therapies to treat AD has become urgent. Presently, the drugs available for AD treatment, including cholinesterase inhibitors and an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, can only inhibit dementia symptoms for a limited period of time but cannot stop or reverse disease progression. On the basis of the amyloid hypothesis, many global drug companies have conducted many clinical trials on amyloid clearing therapy but without success. Thus, the amyloid hypothesis may not be completely feasible. The number of anti-amyloid trials decreased in 2019, which might be a turning point. An in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the contribution of amyloid beta and other factors of AD is crucial for developing novel pharmacotherapies.In ongoing clinical trials, researchers have developed and are testing several possible interventions aimed at various targets, including anti-amyloid and anti-tau interventions, neurotransmitter modification, anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection interventions, and cognitive enhancement, and interventions to relieve behavioral psychological symptoms.

32360163,"Automatic estimations of brain ventricles are needed to assess disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer Disease (AD). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the diagnostic performances of an automated volumetric assessment tool in estimating lateral ventricle volumes in AD and to compare this with Cavalieri's principle, which is accepted as the gold standard method. This is across-sectional volumetric study including 25 Alzheimer patients and 25 healthy subjects undergoing magnetic resonance images (MRI) with a 3D turbo spin echo sequence at 1.5 Tesla. The Atlas-based method incorporated MRIStudio software to automatically measure he volumes of brain ventricles. To compare the corresponding measurements, we used manual point-counting and semi-automatic planimetry methods based on Cavalieri's principle. Bland-Altman test results indicated an excellent agreement between Cavalieri's principle and the Atlas-based method in all volumetric measurements (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We obtained a 64% sensitivity and 92% specificity for lateral ventricular volumes according to the Atlas-based method. AD subjects had significantly larger left and right lateral ventricle volume (LVV) when compared to control subjects in respect to three volumetric methods (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Lateral ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) statistically increased 49.23% in measurements done with the point-counting method, 45.12% with the planimetry method, and 45.49% with the Atlas-based method in AD patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). As a result, the Atlas-based method may be used instead of manual volumetry to estimate brain volumes. Additionally, this method provides rapid and accurate estimations of brain ventricular volumes in-vivo examination of MRI.",Alzheimers Disease

30821607,"Several studies have shown that dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy is associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a cell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, using an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10), previously known as the \u03b3-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel regulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 induced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction assays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B cysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy activation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In addition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity of ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD (Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of TMED10 increased amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) production. Treatment with A\u03b2 increased ATG4B proteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B. Taken together, our results suggest that the AD-associated protein TMED10 negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting ATG4B activity.<b>Abbreviations</b>: A\u03b2: amyloid-\u03b2; AD: Alzheimer disease; ATG: autophagy related; BECN1: beclin 1; BiFC: bimolecular fluorescence complementation; CD: cytosolic domain; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GLUC: <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase; IP: immunoprecipitation; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; LD: luminal domain; PD: Parkinson disease; ROS: reactive oxygen species; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphisms; TD: transmembrane domain; TMED10: transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 10; VC: C terminus of Venus fluorescent protein; VN: N terminus of Venus fluorescent protein.",Alzheimers Disease
31278851,"Down syndrome (DS) is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability worldwide. The overexpression of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, present in chromosome 21, leads to \u03b2-amyloid deposition that results in Alzheimer disease (AD) and, in most cases, also to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) neuropathology. People with DS invariably develop the neuropathological hallmarks of AD at the age of 40, and they are at an ultra high risk for suffering AD-related cognitive impairment thereafter. In the general population, cerebrovascular disease is a significant contributor to AD-related cognitive impairment, while in DS remains understudied. This review describes the current knowledge on cerebrovascular disease in DS and reviews the potential biomarkers that could be useful in the future studies, focusing on CAA. We also discuss available evidence on sporadic AD or other genetically determined forms of AD. We highlight the urgent need of large biomarker-characterized cohorts, including neuropathological correlations, to study the exact contribution of CAA and related vascular factors that play a role in cognition and occur with aging, their characterization and interrelationships. DS represents a unique context in which to perform these studies as this population is relatively protected from some conventional vascular risk factors and they develop significant CAA, DS represents a particular atheroma-free model to study AD-related vascular pathologies. Only deepening on these underlying mechanisms, new preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed to improve the quality of life of this population and their caregivers and lead to new avenues of treatment also in the general AD population.",Alzheimers Disease
31165862,"In sporadic and dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (AD), aggregation of both tau and \u03b1-synuclein may occur in neurons. Aggregates of either protein occur separately or coexist in the same neuron. It is not known whether the coaggregation of tau and \u03b1-synuclein in dominantly inherited AD occurs in association with specific mutations of the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes. The aim of this study was to provide the first characterization of the neuropathologic phenotype associated with the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation in a man who was clinically diagnosed as having AD, but for whom the PSEN1 mutation was found postmortem. The proband, who was 56 years old when cognitive impairment first manifested, died at 67 years of age. Neuropathologically, 3 proteinopathies were present in the brain. Widespread \u03b1-synuclein-immunopositive neuronal inclusions suggested a diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), while severe and widespread tau and amyloid-\u03b2 pathologies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of AD. Immunohistochemistry revealed the coexistence of tau and \u03b1-synuclein aggregates in the same neuron. Neuropathologic and molecular studies in brains of carriers of the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation or other PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutations associated with the coexistence of DLBD and AD are needed to clarify whether tau and \u03b1-synuclein proteinopathies occur independently or whether a relationship exists between \u03b1-synuclein and tau that might explain the mechanisms of coaggregation.",Alzheimers Disease

This overlap, in addition to the lack of consensus clinical criteria for fvAD, complicates its identification. We provide the first case report of fvAD differentiated in vivo from bvFTD using amyloid-beta and tau PET imaging. The patient, a right-handed woman, presented with forgetfulness at age 60. Cognitive testing at that time revealed mild impairments in memory, attention, and executive functions. Three years later, her family reported that she was displaying socially inappropriate behaviors, inertia, diminished social interest, and altered food preferences-the sum of which met the criteria for possible bvFTD. PET using an amyloid-beta tracer (F-AZD4694) identified diffuse amyloid plaques across the cerebral cortex. PET using a tau tracer specific for neurofibrillary tangles (F-MK6240) identified substantial tau pathology in the brain's frontal lobes. Together with the clinical findings, these images supported the diagnosis of fvAD rather than bvFTD.

33335085,"BACKGROUND Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disorder frequently encountered by clinicians. Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary metastatic tumors should be considered as an alternative diagnosis when clinicians encounter patients with lung cancer who demonstrate hyponatremia. However, masked central diabetes insipidus should also be considered to prevent critical dehydration when glucocorticoid replacement therapy will be initiated. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia of 122 mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a metastatic pituitary tumor and endocrinological examinations confirmed panhypopituitarism, including secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone replacement revealed masked diabetes insipidus with elevation of serum sodium levels that reached 151 mmol/L. Desmopressin administration was required to prevent water depletion and to immediately ameliorate the hypernatremia. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case report of masked diabetes insipidus that demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can mask the hypernatremia that is a typical manifestation of diabetes insipidus. Physicians should consider adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus due to pituitary metastasis of advanced malignancies, even when they encounter patients with hyponatremia.",Diabetes

26913870,"Under physiological conditions, fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis is maintained by the kidney adjusting urine volume and composition according to body needs. Diabetes Insipidus is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, Diabetes Insipidus has been described several thousand years later. In 1670s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of Diabetes Insipidus. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of Diabetes Insipidus. An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat Diabetes Insipidus. Until 1920s the available evidence indicated Diabetes Insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary gland. In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with Diabetes Insipidus did not respond to posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of Diabetes Insipidus resistant to this treatment. In 1947 Williams and Henry introduced the term Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus for the congenital syndrome characterized by polyuria and renal concentrating defect resistant to vasopressin. In 1955, du Vigneaud received the 1955 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the first synthesis of the hormone vasopressin representing a milestone for the treatment of Central Diabetes Insipidus. ",Diabetes

DI rats have a deficiency in the synthesis of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a reduced content of pituitary oxytocin (OT). They are characterized also by polyuria, polydipsia, and they seldom ingest high concentrations of NaCl solutions. We also tested if the appetite can be influenced by neurohypophyseal hormones especially oxytocin (OT) because it inhibits SSA in other animals. DI rats and Long Evans (LE) controls were fed ad libitum and given a choice between water, and either 0.9% or 1.8% NaCl. The data showed a significant increase of daily spontaneous water intake in DI compared with LE rats. Both DI and LE ingested similar small spontaneous volumes of the isotonic NaCl solution, but DI rats drank significantly less hypertonic NaCl than the LE controls. I.c.v infusion of AngII induced significant sodium intake in LE rats, but only raised water intake in DI rats. When combined with i.c.v. Ang II, OVT enhanced salt intake in LE animals while AVP attenuated water intake in both groups of rats and blocked NaCl intake completely in LE rats. In conclusion, DI rats did not demonstrate a SSA in response to central administration of AngII, although the drinking of water was enhanced. In combination with i.c.v. AngII, AVP inhibits water drinking in both DI and LE rats. In the LE controls OT attenuates AngII-induced SSA but has no effect in DI rats.",Diabetes
32205050,"In the pregnant patient, hypotonic polyuria in the setting of elevated serum osmolality and polydipsia should narrow the differential to causes related to diabetes insipidus (DI). Gestational DI, also called transient DI of pregnancy, is a distinct entity, unique from central DI or nephrogenic DI which may both become exacerbated during pregnancy. These three different processes relate to vasopressin, where increased metabolism, decreased production or altered renal sensitivity to this neuropeptide should be considered. Gestational DI involves progressively rising levels of placental vasopressinase throughout pregnancy, resulting in decreased endogenous vasopressin and resulting hypotonic polyuria worsening through the pregnancy. Gestational DI should be distinguished from central and nephrogenic DI that may be seen during pregnancy through use of clinical history, urine and serum osmolality measurements, response to desmopressin and potentially, the newer, emerging copeptin measurement. This review focuses on a brief overview of osmoregulatory and vasopressin physiology in pregnancy and how this relates to the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of gestational DI, with comparisons to the other forms of DI during pregnancy. Differentiating the subtypes of DI during pregnancy is critical in order to provide optimal management of DI in pregnancy and avoid dehydration and hypernatremia in this vulnerable population.",Diabetes
32387127,"The two main differential diagnoses of central diabetes insipidus are nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Reliable distinction between those entities is essential as treatment differs substantially with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious complications. Past diagnostic measures using the indirect water deprivation test had several pitfalls, resulting in a low diagnostic accuracy. With the introduction of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was new evaluated. While unstimulated basal copeptin measurement reliably diagnoses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a stimulation test is needed to differentiate patients with central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia. Stimulation can either be achieved through hypertonic saline infusion or arginine infusion. While the former showed high diagnostic accuracy and superiority over the indirect water deprivation test in a recent validation study, the diagnostic accuracy for arginine-stimulated copeptin was slightly lower, but superior in test tolerance.

31004513,"Copeptin is secreted in an equimolar amount to arginine vasopressin (AVP) but can easily be measured in plasma or serum with a sandwich immunoassay. The main stimuli for copeptin are similar to AVP, that is an increase in osmolality and a decrease in arterial blood volume and pressure. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has, therefore, been evaluated as diagnostic biomarker in vasopressin-dependent disorders of body fluid homeostasis. Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper- and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Copeptin measurement has led to a \""revival\"" of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Baseline copeptin levels, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In contrast, for the difficult differentiation between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia, a stimulated copeptin level of 4.9\u00a0pmol/L upon hypertonic saline infusion differentiates these two entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is clearly superior to the classical water deprivation test. On the contrary, in the SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors lead to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer-related disease in SIADH patients can, therefore, not be recommended.",Diabetes
32792133,"Most cases of acquired central diabetes insipidus are caused by destruction of the neurohypophysis by: 1) anatomic lesions that destroy the vasopressin neurons by pressure or infiltration, 2) damage to the vasopressin neurons by surgery or head trauma, and 3) autoimmune destruction of the vasopressin neurons. Because the vasopressin neurons are located in the hypothalamus, lesions confined to the sella turcica generally do not cause diabetes insipidus because the posterior pituitary is simply the site of the axon terminals that secrete vasopressin into the bloodstream. In addition, the capacity of the neurohypophysis to synthesize vasopressin is greatly in excess of the body's needs, and destruction of 80-90% of the hypothalamic vasopressin neurons is required to produce diabetes insipidus. As a result, even large lesions in the sellar and suprasellar area generally are not associated with impaired water homeostasis until they are surgically resected. Regardless of the etiology of central diabetes insipidus, deficient or absent vasopressin secretion causes impaired urine concentration with resultant polyuria. In most cases, secondary polydipsia is able to maintain water homeostasis at the expense of frequent thirst and drinking. However, destruction of the osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus that regulate vasopressin neuronal activity causes a loss of thirst as well as vasopressin section, leading to severe chronic dehydration and hyperosmolality. Vasopressin deficiency also leads to down-regulation of the synthesis of aquaporin-2 water channels in the kidney collecting duct principal cells, causing a secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. As a result, several days of vasopressin administration are required to achieve maximal urine concentration in patients with CDI. Consequently, the presentation of patients with central diabetes insipidus can vary greatly, depending on the size and location of the lesion, the magnitude of trauma to the neurohypophysis, the degree of destruction of the vasopressin neurons, and the presence of other hormonal deficits from damage to the anterior pituitary.",Diabetes

In X-linked NDI, V2R is dysfunctional, which leads to impaired water reabsorption. These patients have functional AQP2, and thus the challenge is to achieve AQP2 membrane insertion independently of V2R. The current treatment is symptomatic and is based on distally acting diuretics (thiazide or amiloride) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin). This mini-review covers published data from trials in preclinical in vivo models and a few human intervention studies to improve NDI by more causal approaches. Promising effects on NDI in preclinical studies have been demonstrated by the use of pharmacological approaches with secretin, Wnt5a, protein kinase A agonist, fluconazole, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> EP2 and EP4 agonists, statins, metformin, and soluble prorenin receptor agonists. In patients, only casuistic reports have evaluated the effect of statins, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (rolipram and sildenafil), and the guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat without amelioration of symptoms. It is concluded that there is currently no established intervention that causally improves symptoms or quality of life in patients with NDI. There is a need to collaborate to improve study quality and conduct formal trials.",Diabetes

27156762,"Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia owing to partial or complete deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP). Although in most patients non-hereditary causes underlie the disorder, genetic forms have long been recognized and studied both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. In most affected families, the disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, whereas autosomal recessive forms are much less frequent. Both phenotypes can be caused by mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP) gene. In transfected cells expressing dominant mutations, the mutated hormone precursor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms fibrillar aggregates. Autopsy studies in humans and a murine knock-in model suggest that the dominant phenotype results from toxicity to vasopressinergic neurons, but the mechanisms leading to cell death remain unclear. Recessive transmission results from AVP with reduced biologic activity or the deletion of the locus. Genetic neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus occurring in the context of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness is termed DIDMOAD or Wolfram syndrome, a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the wolframin (WFS 1) gene.",Diabetes

32244049,"Cancer immunotherapy is a breakthrough strategy entwined with toxicity. Immune-related hypophysitis is conventionally considered distinctive of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. Immune-related central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is exceptional. CDI rarely manifests as hypernatremia, which is almost always euvolemic. We report a 71-years-old male patient with advanced lung cancer who experienced severe chronic hypernatremia presented as alterations in mental status five months after initiation of treatment with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. Combination of persistenthypernatremia, polyuria, high plasma osmolality and hyposthenuria raised suspicion of diabetes insipidus, prompting measurement of serum concentration of arginine vasopressin(AVP). The inappropriately undetectable serum levels of AVP confirmed central diabetes insipidus (CDI). Nivolumab-related hypophysitis was recognized as possible cause of CDI. Further hormonal assessment excluded any endocrinopathy indicating disorder of posterior pituitary. Pituitary MRI was normal with persistence of hyperintensity of posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images (bright spot). The patient was scheduled to receive 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), but he died suddenly due to cardiac arrest before initiation of treatment. Our report describes the first case of nivolumab related CDI, building on existing literature through: (I) underscoring hypovolemic hypernatremia as CDI manifestation; (ii) bringing into spotlight the rare anti-PD-1 treatment related hypophysitis; (iii) enriching the limited evidence on immune-related CDI.

33786230,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is an endocrine condition involving the posterior pituitary peptide hormone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH exerts its effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the nephron by upregulating aquaporin-2 channels (AQP2) on the cellular apical membrane surface. DI is marked by expelling excessive quantities of highly dilute urine, extreme thirst, and craving for cold water. The two main classifications of DI are central diabetes insipidus (CDI), characterized by a deficiency of the posterior pituitary gland to release ADH, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), characterized by the terminal distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct resistance to ADH. The two less common classifications include dipsogenic DI, characterized by excessive thirst due to a low osmotic threshold, and gestational DI, characterized by increased concentration of placental vasopressinase during pregnancy. Treatment of DI is dependent on the disease classification, but severe complications may arise if not tended to appropriately. The most important step in symptom management is maintaining fluid intake ahead of fluid loss with emphasis placed on preserving the quality of life. The most common treatment of CDI and gestational DI is the administration of synthetic ADH, desmopressin (DDAVP). Nephrogenic treatment, although more challenging, requires discontinuation of medications as well as maintaining a renal-friendly diet to prevent hypernatremia. Treatment of dipsogenic DI is mainly focused on behavioral therapy aimed at regulating water intake and/or administration of antipsychotic pharmaceutical therapy. Central and nephrogenic subtypes of DI share a paradoxical treatment in thiazide diuretics.",Diabetes

In addition, serum anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies that have been recently reported as a biomarker of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis, were positive. Diabetes insipidus continued after delivery, suggesting that polyuria was not mainly due to excessive vasopressinase activity or reduced renal sensitivity to AVP by prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> that can cause temporal polyuria during pregnancy.

27172867,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication of pregnancy. It is usually transient, being due to increased placental production of vasopressinase that inactivates circulating vasopressin.

Acquired central DI can also occur during pregnancy, for example in a patient with hypophysitis or neuroinfundibulitis during late pregnancy or postpartum. Finally, pre-existing central or nephrogenic DI may occasionally be unmasked by pregnancy. Treatment with dDAVP (desmopressin, Minirin(\u00ae)) is very effective on transient DI of pregnancy and also on pre-existing or acquired central DI.

At the age of 4 years, calcification of the bilateral renal medulla was detected by computed tomography. Subsequently his urinary volume gradually increased and polyuria of approximately 4 L/day persisted. At the age of 27 years, he became fond of sugar-sweetened drinks and also often forgot to take the medicine. He was admitted to our hospital due to polyuria of more than 10 L day, muscle weakness and gait disturbance. Laboratory tests disclosed worsening of both hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in addition to severe hyperglycemia. It seemed likely that occurrence of diabetes mellitus and cessation of medications can induce osmotic diuresis and aggravate hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Consequently, severe dehydration, hypokalemia-induced damage of his urinary concentration ability and enhancement of the renin angiotensin system occurred and thereby possibly worsened his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. As normalization of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis might have exacerbated hypokalemia further, dehydration and hypokalemia were treated first. Following intensive treatment, these abnormalities were improved, but polyuria persisted.

30019932,"The antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) is produced by the hypothalamus and is stored and secreted from the posterior pituitary. VP acts via VP type 2 receptors (V2Rs) on the basolateral membrane of principal cells of the collecting duct (CD) to regulate fluid permeability. The VP-evoked endocrine pathway is essential in determining urine concentrating capability. For example, a defect in any component of the VP signaling pathway can result in polyuria, polydipsia, and hypotonic urine, collectively termed diabetes insipidus (DI). A lack of VP production precipitates central diabetes insipidus (CDI), which can be managed effectively by VP supplementation. A majority of cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) result from V2R mutations that impair receptor sensitivity. No specific therapy is currently available for management of NDI. Evidence is evolving that (pro)renin receptor (PRR), a newly identified member of the renin-angiotensin system, is capable of regulating VP production and action.

31986514,"Diabetes insipidus (DI), be it from central or from nephrogenic origin, has to be differentiated from primary polydipsia. This differentiation is crucial since wrong treatment can have dangerous consequences. For decades, the \""gold standard\"" for differential diagnosis has been the standard water deprivation test. However, this test has several limitations leading to an overall limited diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the test has a long duration of 17 h and is cumbersome for patients. Also clinical signs and symptoms and MRI characteristics overlap between patients with DI and primary polydipsia. Direct measurement of arginine vasopressin (AVP) upon osmotic stimulation was first shown to overcome these limitations, but failed to enter clinical practice mainly due to technical limitations of the AVP assay. Copeptin is secreted in equimolar ratio to AVP, mirroring AVP concentrations in the circulation. We have shown that copeptin, without prior fluid deprivation, identifies patients with nephrogenic DI. For the more difficult differentiation between central DI and primary polydipsia, a copeptin level of 4.9 pmol/L stimulated with hypertonic saline infusion differentiates between these 2 entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is superior to the water deprivation test. However, it is important to note that close and regular sodium monitoring every 30 min during the hypertonic saline test is a prerequisite, which is not possible in all hospitals. Furthermore, side effects are common. Therefore, a nonosmotic stimulation test would be advantageous.

Recently, we have found that adolescent homozygous Brattleboro (Hom) rats, which contain a mutation in the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene, exhibit lower behavioral arousal than their heterozygous (Het) littermates in the open field test. This hypoaroused phenotype could be due to loss of AVP in magnocellular cells that supply AVP to the peripheral circulation and project to limbic structures or parvocellular cells that regulate the stress axis and other central targets. Alternatively, hypoarousal could be a side effect of diabetes insipidus - polydipsia and polyuria seen in Hom rats due to loss of AVP facilitation of water reabsorption in the kidney. We developed a viral-rescue approach to \""cure\"" magnocellular AVP cells of their Brattleboro mutation.

27807328,"To explore the influence of preventive use of vasopressin tannate on diabetes insipidus and serum sodium at the early postoperation of craniopharyngioma.\u2029 Methods: The data of 83 patients, who underwent unilateral sub-frontal approach resection of craniopharyngioma between 2010 and 2014 by the same senior neurosurgeon, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into a vasopressin tannate group (used group) and a control group. The diabetes insipidus and serum sodium changes were compared between the two groups.\u2029 Results: Compared with the control group, the incidence of diabetes insipidus decreased at the early postoperation in the vasopressin tannate group (P<0.05). There was high incidence of diabetes insipidus in patients with pituitary stalk excision and tumor close adhesion to the third ventricle floor at the early postoperation (P<0.05). Under such conditions, the incidence of diabetes insipidus in the vasopressin tannate group was decreased compared with the control group (P<0.05). Postoperative hypernatremia occurred in 37 patients (44.6%), and hyponatremia occurred in 60 patients (72.3%), the average time of the occurrence of hpernatremia and hyponatremia was 1.4 and 3.7 days after surgery. Postoperative high serum sodium and low serum sodium appeared alternately in 19 patients (22.9%). There was significant difference in the serum sodium distribution in the first day after surgery in both groups (P<0.05), and the percent of hpernatremia in the vasopressin tannate group was significantly less than that in the control group (P<0.05).\u2029 Conclusion: Preventive use of vasopressin tannate can effectively reduce diabetes insipidus and hypernatremia incidence at the early postoperative stage after microsurgery for craniopharyngioma.",Diabetes

30269342,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impairment of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary. In clinical practice, it needs to be distinguished from renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI), and abnormalities of thirst appreciation (primary polydipsia). As nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare in adults, unless they are treated with lithium salts, the practical challenge is how to differentiate between CDI and clinical disorders of excess thirst. The differential diagnosis is usually straight forward, but the recommended gold standard test, the water deprivation test, is not without interpretative pitfalls. The addition of the measurement of plasma AVP concentrations improves diagnostic accuracy, but the radioimmunoassay for AVP is technically difficult, and is only available in a few specialized centres. More recently, the measurement of plasma copeptin concentrations has been claimed to provide a reliable alternative to measurement of plasma AVP, without the sampling handling challenges. In addition, the measurement of thirst ratings can help the differentiation between CDI and primary polydipsia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is biochemically certain, investigations to determine the cause of AVP deficiency are needed. In this review, we will outline the diagnostic approach to polyuria, revisit the caveats of the water deprivation test and review recent data on value of adding AVP/copeptin measurement. We will also discuss treatment strategies for CDI, with analysis of potential complications of treatment.",Diabetes

A bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) with additional monosomy 7. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed following a water deprivation test. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a slightly thickened pituitary stalk, stable Rathke's cyst, and new absence of the pituitary bright spot.

Biochemical hypogonadotropic hypogonadism persisted but was uninterpretable in the context of systemic illness and recent chemotherapy. DI is a rare complication of haematological malignancies, and the prevalence and pathophysiology of DI in this context are poorly understood. Pathogenic mechanisms proposed include leukaemic infiltration of the pituitary, interference with antidiuretic hormone synthesis, and abnormal thrombopoiesis influencing hormone levels. Particular cytogenetic abnormalities such as inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) and monosomy 7 appear to be more commonly associated with DI and also appear to confer worse outcomes.

Pseudo-TORCH syndrome is an umbrella term, consisting of several syndromes, resultant from different genetic alterations and pathogenetic mechanisms. Band-like calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG) is one of these conditions, resultant from biallelic mutations in the OCLN gene, located in the chromosome 5q13.2. OCLN gene encodes occludin, a tight junction protein, which is expressed in the endothelia.

The patient was found to have profound hypernatremia and severe hypercalcemia with normal parathyroid and vitamin D serum levels. Urine studies showed low urine osmolality and high urine output, despite the higher serum osmolality. The patient received 5% dextrose for rehydration, 1 dose of intravenous (IV) pamidronate, 1 dose of IV desmopressin, and 4 days of subcutaneous calcitonin 200 international units Q12H. Initially, her urine output in the hospital was in the range of 350-400 milliliters/hour, which responded well to 1 dose of 1-desamino-8d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). In the subsequent days, her confusion resolved with normalization of serum sodium and calcium, but she died because of the extensive malignancy.

The catheter was pulled out and the DI settled. DI may occur as a consequence of SAH. The rationale behind reporting this case is to differentiate the cause of DI; as following insertion of EVD in a patient of SAH, the development of DI should raise the suspicion of misplaced EVD, should not be left as a consequence of SAH and appropriate imaging should be obtained. To prevent this happening, preoperative verification of CT, image-guided insertion, measurement of the length of the tubing and careful anchorage of EVD to surrounding tissue are necessary.",Diabetes

20888099,"Diabetes insipidus is an ancient disease considered under the rubric of diabetes, the Greek descriptive term for polyuria, which was unrecognized even after the sweetness of urine was reported as a characteristic of diabetes mellitus in the 17th century. It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland in the opening decades of the 20th century. Simultaneously, posterior pituitary lobe extracts were shown to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone). As vasopressin was purified and synthesized and its assay became available, it was shown to be released in response to both osmotic and volume stimuli that are integrated in the hypothalamus, and vasopressin thereby was essential to maintaining internal water balance. The antidiuretic properties of vasopressin to treat the rare cases of diabetes insipidus were of limited clinical utility until its vasoconstrictive effects were resuscitated in the 1970s, with the consequent increasing wider use of vasopressin for the treatment of compromised hemodynamic states. In addition, the discovery of antidiuretic hormone receptor blockers has led to their increasing use in managing hypo-osmolar states.",Diabetes
32153511,"<b>Purpose:</b> To increase knowledge for the early differential diagnosis and accurate therapeutic strategies for pediatric patients with sellar or suprasellar region (SSR) lesions who initially present with central diabetes insipidus (CDI). <b>Methods:</b> This is a retrospective review of 55 pediatric patients (\u226414 years old) with identified lesions in the SSR who initially presented with CDI at a large pituitary center between 2012 and 2018. The following data were summarized: demographic, clinical, endocrine, and neuroimaging data, intraoperative findings, histopathological findings, treatments, and prognosis. <b>Results:</b> In our group, the etiologies of the SSR lesions included germ cell tumors (GCTs, 74.5%), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH, 18.2%), and craniopharyngioma (CP, 7.3%). Almost all patients (50/55, 90.9%) showed anterior pituitary dysfunction [multiple axes dysfunction (38), and isolated axis dysfunction (14)], while the GH/IGF-I axis was the most affected. Most GCT patients presented with various clinical manifestations besides CDI and had elevated \u03b2-HCG, whereas LCH and CP patients mostly presented few non-specific symptoms besides CDI and most had normal level tumor markers. Sellar MRI demonstrated that posterior pituitary bright spot disappearance occurred in all patients, and pituitary stalk thickening was observed in 96.7% of patients. Treatment varied due to the different etiologies of the SSR lesions. After follow-up for 35.4 \u00b1 20.2 months, the proportions of patients who needed AVP (arginine vasopressin) for GCT, LCH, and CP were 86.5, 100, and 75%, respectively, and the proportions of patients who needed HRT were 89.2, 50, and 75%, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> For pediatric SSR lesions that first manifest as CDI, we should comprehensively consider clinical characteristics and imaging features to aid in their early differential diagnosis. Tumor markers and surgical histopathology are also great complements for the differential diagnosis. Additionally, various treatment strategies should be adopted according to different causes to improve the child's prognosis and quality of life.",Diabetes
25211589,"Diabetes mellitus, widely known to the ancients for polyuria and glycosuria, budded off diabetes insipidus (DI) about 200 years ago, based on the glucose-free polyuria that characterized a subset of patients. In the late 19th century, clinicians identified the posterior pituitary as the site of pathology, and pharmacologists found multiple bioactivities there. Early in the 20th century, the amelioration of the polyuria with extracts of the posterior pituitary inaugurated a new era in therapy and advanced the hypothesis that DI was due to a hormone deficiency. Decades later, a subset of patients with polyuria unresponsive to therapy were recognized, leading to the distinction between central DI and nephrogenic DI, an early example of a hormone-resistant condition. Recognition that the posterior pituitary had 2 hormones was followed by du Vigneaud's Nobel Prize winning isolation, sequencing, and chemical synthesis of oxytocin and vasopressin. The pure hormones accelerated the development of bioassays and immunoassays that confirmed the hormone deficiency in vasopressin-sensitive DI and abundant levels of hormone in patients with the nephrogenic disorder. With both forms of the disease, acquired and inborn defects were recognized. Emerging concepts of receptors and of genetic analysis led to the recognition of patients with mutations in the genes for 1) arginine vasopressin (AVP), 2) the AVP receptor 2 (AVPR2), and 3) the aquaporin 2 water channel (AQP2).

31588538,"Body fluid homeostasis is essential for normal life. In the maintenance of water balance, the most important factor and regulated process is the excretory function of the kidneys. The kidneys are capable to compensate not only the daily fluctuations of water intake but also the consequences of fluid loss (respiration, perspiration, sweating, hemorrhage). The final volume and osmolality of the excreted urine is set in the collecting duct via hormonal regulation. The hormone of water conservation is the vasopressin (AVP), and a large volume of urine is produced and excreted in the absence of AVP secretion or if AVP is ineffective in the kidneys. The aquaporin-2 water channel (AQP2) is expressed in the principal cells, and it plays an essential role in the reabsorption of water in the collecting ducts via type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R)-mediated mechanism. If neural or hormonal regulation fails to operate the normal function of AVP-V2R-AQP2 system, it can result in various diseases such as diabetes insipidus (DI) or nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (NSIAD).

29125546,"Under physiological conditions, excessive loss of water through the urine is prevented by the release of the antidiuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the posterior pituitary. In the kidney, AVP elicits a number of cellular responses, which converge on increasing the osmotic reabsorption of water in the collecting duct. One of the key events triggered by the binding of AVP to its type-2 receptor (AVPR2) is the exocytosis of the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2) at the apical membrane the principal cells of the collecting duct. Mutations of either AVPR2 or AQP2 result in a genetic disease known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by the lack of responsiveness of the collecting duct to the antidiuretic action of AVP. The affected subject, being incapable of concentrating the urine, presents marked polyuria and compensatory polydipsia and is constantly at risk of severe dehydration. The molecular bases of the disease are fully uncovered, as well as the genetic or clinical tests for a prompt diagnosis of the disease in newborns. A real cure for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is still missing, and the main symptoms of the disease are handled with s continuous supply of water, a restrictive diet, and nonspecific drugs.

No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off (\""off periods\""), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation.

32737460,"The classic view portrays Parkinson disease (PD) as a motor disorder resulting from loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons. Multiple studies, however, describe prodromal, non-motor dysfunctions that affect the quality of life of patients who subsequently develop PD. These prodromal dysfunctions comprise a wide array of gastrointestinal motility disorders including dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying and chronic constipation. The histological hallmark of PD - misfolded \u03b1-synuclein aggregates that form Lewy bodies and neurites - is detected in the enteric nervous system prior to clinical diagnosis, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract and its neural (vagal) connection to the central nervous system could have a major role in disease aetiology. This Review provides novel insights on the pathogenesis of PD, including gut-to-brain trafficking of \u03b1-synuclein as well as the newly discovered nigro-vagal pathway, and highlights how vagal connections from the gut could be the conduit by which ingested environmental pathogens enter the central nervous system and ultimately induce, or accelerate, PD progression. The pathogenic potential of various environmental neurotoxicants and the suitability and translational potential of experimental animal models of PD will be highlighted and appraised. Finally, the clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement in PD and medications will be discussed briefly.",Parkinsons Disease
31464647,"Mutations in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are among the most common known genetic risk factors for the development of Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies. A great deal is known about GBA1, as mutations in GBA1 are causal for the rare autosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the genetics and cell biology of glucocerebrosidase. A least 495 different mutations, found throughout the 11 exons of the gene are reported, including both common and rare variants. Mutations in GBA1 may lead to degradation of the protein, disruptions in lysosomal targeting and diminished performance of the enzyme in the lysosome.Gaucher disease is phenotypically diverse and has both neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms. Both patients with Gaucher disease and heterozygous carriers are at increased risk of developing Parkinson disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, although our understanding of the mechanism for this association remains incomplete. There appears to be an inverse relationship between glucocerebrosidase and \u03b1-synuclein levels, and even patients with sporadic Parkinson disease have decreased glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase may interact with \u03b1-synuclein to maintain basic cellular functions, or impaired glucocerebrosidase could contribute to Parkinson pathogenesis by disrupting lysosomal homeostasis, enhancing endoplasmic reticulum stress or contributing to mitochondrial impairment. However, the majority of patients with GBA1 mutations never develop parkinsonism, so clearly other risk factors play a role. Treatments for Gaucher disease have been developed that increase visceral glucocerebrosidase levels and decrease lipid storage, although they have yet to properly address the neurological defects associated with impaired glucocerebrosidase. Mouse and induced pluripotent stem cell derived models have improved our understanding of glucocerebrosidase function and the consequences of its deficiency. These models have been used to test novel therapies including chaperone proteins, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and gene therapy approaches that enhance glucocerebrosidase levels and could prove efficacious in the treatment of forms of parkinsonism. Consequently, this rare monogenic disorder, Gaucher disease, provides unique insights directly applicable to our understanding and treatment of Parkinson disease, a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder.",Parkinsons Disease

32222721,"BACKGROUND Camptocormia is an axis symptom of Parkinson disease. It remains uncertain whether treatment with medications and surgery are effective. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in Parkinson disease-associated camptocormia and explored some of its mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Parkinson disease-associated camptocormia was diagnosed by the following procedures. All patients underwent bilateral STN DBS. The patents' camptocormia was rated by degree and MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) item 3.13 before and after DBS surgery. Rehabilitation and psychological interventions were used after surgery, in addition to adjustments of medication and stimulus parameters. The treatment effects on camptocormia were assessed comparing medication-off (presurgery) versus stimulation-on (post-surgery). Ethical approval for this study was provided through the Center of Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 2019-35). This study trial was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR1900022655). All the participants provided written informed consent. RESULTS After DBS surgery, all of study patients' symptoms were improved, with different levels of improvement. The minimum and maximum improvement rates were 20% and 100% respectively. The score of item 3.13 of the MDS-UPDRS III and the degree of camptocormia were found to be obviously improved (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS STN DBS can improve Parkinson disease-associated camptocormia; STN DBS assisted with rehabilitation and psychological intervention appears to be more effective.",Parkinsons Disease

31631455,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. In Europe, prevalence and incidence rates for PD are estimated at approximately 108-257/100\u00a0000 and 11-19/100\u00a0000 per year, respectively. Risk factors include age, male gender and some environmental factors. The aetiology of the disease in most patients is unknown, but different genetic causes have been identified. Although familial forms of PD account for only 5%-15% of cases, studies on these families provided interesting insight on the genetics and the pathogenesis of the disease allowing the identification of genes implicated in its pathogenesis and offering critical insights into the mechanisms of disease. The cardinal motor symptoms of PD are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia/akinesia and postural instability, but the clinical picture includes other motor and non-motor symptoms. Its diagnosis is principally clinical, although specific investigations can help the differential diagnosis from other forms of parkinsonism. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and by accumulation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein, which is found in intra-cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies. Currently available treatments offer good control of motor symptoms but do not modify the evolution of the disease.

However, there are conflicting reports from in vivo human studies. <sup>11</sup>C-dihydrotetrabenazine (<sup>11</sup>C-DTBZ) is a vesicular monoamine type 2 transporter PET ligand that allows assessment of nigrostriatal presynaptic dopaminergic terminal integrity. Correlational tractography based on diffusion MRI can incorporate ligand-specific information provided by <sup>11</sup>C-DTBZ PET into the fiber-tracking process. The purpose of this study was to assess the in vivo association between the integrity of the nigrostriatal tract (defined by correlational tractography) and the degree of striatal dopaminergic denervation based on <sup>11</sup>C-DTBZ PET. <b>Methods:</b> The study involved 30 subjects with mild to moderate PD (23 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 \u00b1 6.2 y; disease duration, 6.4 \u00b1 4.0 y; Hoehn and Yahr stage, 2.1 \u00b1 0.6; Movement Disorder Society [MDS]-revised Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] [I-III] total score, 43.4 \u00b1 17.8) and 30 control subjects (18 men and 12 women; mean age, 62 \u00b1 10.3 y). <sup>11</sup>C-DTBZ PET was performed using standard synthesis and acquisition protocols.

30966861,"Aging-related, nonresolving inflammation in both the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery predisposes individuals to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). Inflammasomes are thought to be especially relevant to immune homeostasis, and their dysregulation contributes to inflammation and NDDs. However, few agents have been clinically shown to reduce NDD incidence by targeting inflammasomes. Our study indicated that NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome is involved in Parkinson disease (PD) progression in patients and various murine models. In addition, the small molecule kaempferol (Ka) protected mice against LPS- and SNCA-induced neurodegeneration by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by the fact that Ka reduced cleaved CASP1 expression and disrupted NLRP3-PYCARD-CASP1 complex assembly with concomitant decreased IL1B secretion. Mechanically, Ka promoted macroautophagy/autophagy in microglia, leading to reduced NLRP3 protein expression, which in turn deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome. Intriguingly, ubiquitination was involved in Ka-induced autophagic NLRP3 degradation. These findings were further confirmed <i>in vivo</i> as knockdown of <i>Atg5</i> expression or autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly inhibited the Ka-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and neurodegeneration amelioration. Thus, we demonstrated that Ka promotes neuroinflammatory inhibition via the cooperation of ubiquitination and autophagy, suggesting that Ka is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs. <b>Abbreviations:</b> 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; AAV: adeno-associated virus; ACTB: actin, beta; AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; BafA1: bafilomycin A<sub>1;</sub> BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CASP1: caspase 1; CNS: central nervous system; CQ: chloroquine; DA neurons: dopaminergic neurons; DAMPS: damage-associated molecular patterns; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; IP: immunoprecipitation; i.p.: intraperitoneally; Ka: kaempferol; KD: knockdown; KO: knockout; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; IL1B: interleukin 1 beta; IL6: interleukin 6; Ly: lysate; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MPTP: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; NC: negative control; NDD: neurodegenerative diseases; NLRP3: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; OE: overexpression; PD: Parkinson disease; poly-Ub: poly-ubiquitin; PTM: post-translational modification; PYCARD/ASC: PYD and CARD domain containing; Rapa: rapamycin; RFP: red fluorescent protein; SN: supernatant; SNCA: synuclein alpha; SNpc: substantia nigra pars compacta; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; TNF/TNF-alpha: tumor necrosis factor; Ub: ubiquitin; WT: wild type.",Parkinsons Disease

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well. In this review we highlight the main factors and the current state of the art on obesity as risk factor for influenza and COVID-19 hospitalization, severe respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary complications and even death. Finally, immunoregulatory mechanisms of severe influenza pneumonia in individuals with obesity are addressed as likely factors involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.",Obesity
33512658,"This article aims to provide guidance on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in patients with genetic obesity. Key principals of the management of patients with genetic obesity during COVID-19 pandemic for patients that have contracted COVID-19 are to be aware of: possible adrenal insufficiency (e.g., POMC deficiency, PWS); a more severe course in patients with concomitant immunodeficiency (e.g., LEP and LEPR deficiency), although defective leptin signalling could also be protective against the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19; disease severity being masked by insufficient awareness of symptoms in syndromic obesity patients with intellectual deficit (in particular PWS); to adjust medication dose to increased body size, preferably use dosing in m2; the high risk of malnutrition in patients with Sars-Cov2 infection, even in case of obesity. Key principals of the obesity management during the pandemic are to strive for optimal obesity management and a healthy lifestyle within the possibilities of the regulations to prevent weight (re)gain and to address anxiety within consultations, since prevalence of anxiety for COVID-19 is underestimated.",Obesity

Primary healthcare services have a role to play in ensuring early detection of weight issues and in directing patients towards evidence-based care to slow this progression. Research shows that many people with obesity are motivated to lose weight and want their clinician to initiate a conversation about weight management and treatment options. However, this conversation rarely occurs and there is a significant delay in treatment, resulting in an increased burden on the individual, healthcare system and society. In this paper, the components and rationale for the clinical assessment of adult patients with overweight or obesity, including anthropometric measurements and pathology tests, are described. Recommendations to ascertain the potential factors influencing the development of obesity in the patient, such as lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and mental health, are also provided. The potential sequelae of obesity that may be present and the necessary assessments for diagnosis are also addressed.

The results showed that SHBG overexpression protected against body weight gain and fat accumulation induced by HFD. In addition, SHBG overexpression also abrogated the increase in insulin, leptin and resistin levels, as well as the reduction in adiponectin, induced by HFD. Mechanistically, the SHBG protection against HFD-induced obesity was achieved by stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue.

34029507,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity has been associated with increased incidence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recently intriguing data in mouse models suggested that obesity increases survival in animals with MDS.<b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective analysis using the Moffitt MDS database. Obesity was defined by using body mass index (BMI), whereby a BMI \u2265 30 was regarded as obese.<b>Results:</b> Among 3089 MDS patients with known BMI, 963 patients (31%) were categorized as obese. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients with BMI \u2265 30 and those with <30. The median OS for patients with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930 was 34 months compared to 37 months for those with BMI < 30 (<i>p</i> 0.04). For patients with lower-risk MDS median OS was 52 months versus 57 months, respectively, (<i>p</i> 0.08) while for higher-risk patients median OS was 17 months for both groups.

33719175,"Emerging data suggest an association between obesity and infectious diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.",Obesity

33616242,"Obesity is a risk factor for developing several cancers. The dysfunctional metabolism and chronic activation of inflammatory pathways in obesity create a milieu that supports tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Obesity-associated metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory mediators, besides interacting with cells leading to a malignant transformation, also modify the intrinsic metabolic and functional characteristics of immune myeloid cells. Here, the evidence supporting the hypothesis that obesity metabolically primes and promotes the expansion of myeloid cells with immunosuppressive and pro-oncogenic properties is discussed. In consequence, the accumulation of these cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and some subtypes of adipose-tissue macrophages, creates a microenvironment conducive to tumor development. In this review, the role of lipids, insulin, and leptin, which are dysregulated in obesity, is emphasized, as well as dietary nutrients in metabolic reprogramming of these myeloid cells. Moreover, emerging evidence indicating that obesity enhances immunotherapy response and hypothesized mechanisms are summarized. Priorities in deeper exploration involving the mechanisms of cross talk between metabolic disorders and myeloid cells related to cancer risk in patients with obesity are highlighted.",Obesity

Being linked with numerous comorbidities and complications, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic inflammation, and osteoarthritis (OA), obesity represents one of the most threatening challenges for modern healthcare. Mouse models are an invaluable tool for investigating the effects of diets and their bioactive components against high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and its comorbidities. During recent years, very high fat diets (VHFDs), providing 58-60% kcal fat, have become a popular alternative to more traditional HFDs, providing 40-45% total kcal fat, due to the faster induction of obesity and stronger metabolic responses. This project aims to investigate if the 60% fat VHFD is suitable to evaluate the protective effects of curcumin in diet-induced obesity and osteoarthritis. B6 male mice, prone to diet-induced metabolic dysfunction, were supplemented with VHFD without or with curcumin for 13 weeks. Under these experimental conditions, feeding mice a VHFD for 13 weeks did not result in expected robust manifestations of the targeted pathophysiologic conditions. Supplementing the diet with curcumin, in turn, protected the animals against obesity without significant changes in white adipocyte size, glucose clearance, and knee cartilage integrity.

34070553,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. Metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may stimulate amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregate formation. AD, obesity, and T2DM share similar features such as chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and impaired energy metabolism. Adiposity is associated with the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Adiposity-related inflammatory factors lead to the formation of inflammasome complexes, which are responsible for the activation, maturation, and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Activation of the inflammasome complex, particularly NLRP3, has a crucial role in obesity-induced inflammation, insulin resistance, and T2DM. The abnormal activation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway influences neuroinflammatory processes. NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 signaling could underlie the association between adiposity and cognitive impairment in humans.

33899337,"There is a genetic component to human obesity that accounts for 40% to 50% of the variability in body weight status but that is lower among normal weight individuals (about 30%) and substantially higher in the subpopulation of individuals with obesity and severe obesity (about 60%-80%). The appreciation that heritability varies across classes of BMI represents an important advance. After controlling for BMI, ectopic fat and fat distribution traits are characterized by heritability levels ranging from 30% to 55%. Defects in at least 15 genes are the cause of monogenic obesity cases, resulting mostly from deficiencies in the leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway. Approximately two-thirds of the BMI heritability can be imputed to common DNA variants, whereas low-frequency and rare variants explain the remaining fraction. Diminishing allele effect size is observed as the number of obesity-associated variants expands, with most BMI-increasing or -decreasing alleles contributing only a few grams or less to body weight. Obesity-promoting alleles exert minimal effects in normal weight individuals but have larger effects in individuals with a proneness to obesity, suggesting a higher penetrance; however, it is not known whether these larger effect sizes precede obesity or are caused by an obese state. The obesity genetic risk is conditioned by thousands of DNA variants that make genetically based obesity prevention and treatment a major challenge.",Obesity

This polyphenol has anticancer and antioxidant properties and cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Other favorable effects attributed to resveratrol are anti-lipid, anti-aging, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and neuroprotective actions. Administration of resveratrol appears to improve the metabolic profile in obese and/or insulin-resistant patients. This article aims to review the main results of clinical studies evaluating the effects of administering resveratrol alone in overweight/obese patients.",Obesity
33921695,"The role of unhealthy dietary pattern in the association between socio-economic factors and obesity is unclear. The aim was to examine the association between socio-economic disadvantage and obesity and to assess mediation effect of unhealthy dietary pattern defined using the Mediterranean diet criteria. The data source was the Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. The study sample included 7744 participants aged 18 years and over, 28% of whom had obesity. We used the Australian Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) classification system for categorizing socio-economic disadvantage; calculated the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) using standard criteria; and used measured body mass index to define obesity. We conducted a mediation analysis using log-binomial models to generate the prevalence ratio for obesity and the proportion mediated by the MDS. The most disadvantaged group was associated with higher level of obesity after controlling for covariates (1.40, 95% CI 1.25, 1.56) compared to the least disadvantaged group, and in a dose-response way for each decreasing SEIFA quintile. The relationship between socio-economic disadvantage and obesity was mediated by the MDS (4.0%, 95% CI 1.9, 8.0). Public health interventions should promote healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, to reduce obesity, especially in communities with high socio-economic disadvantage.",Obesity
33917063,"In children and adolescents, obesity does not seem to depend on a reduction of resting energy expenditure (REE). Moreover, in this young population, the interactions between either age and obesity or between age and gender, or the role of leptin on REE are not clearly understood. To compare the levels of REE in children and adolescents we studied 181 Caucasian individuals (62% girls) classified on the basis of age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) percentile as healthy weight (<i>n</i> = 50), with overweight (<i>n</i> = 34), or with obesity (<i>n</i> = 97) and in different age groups: 8-10 (<i>n</i> = 38), 11-13 (<i>n</i> = 50), and 14-17 years (<i>n</i> = 93). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition by air displacement plethysmography. Statistically significant differences in REE/fat-free mass (FFM) regarding obesity or gender were not observed. Absolute REE increases with age (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but REE/FFM decreases (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and there is an interaction between gender and age (<i>p</i> < 0.001) on absolute REE showing that the age-related increase is more marked in boys than in girls, in line with a higher FFM. Interestingly, the effect of obesity on absolute REE is not observed in the 8-10 year-old group, in which serum leptin concentrations correlate with the REE/FFM (<i>r</i> = 0.48; <i>p</i> = 0.011). In conclusion, REE/FFM is not affected by obesity or gender, while the effect of age on absolute REE is gender-dependent and leptin may influence the REE/FFM in 8-10 year-olds.",Obesity
33765600,"The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries. Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.",Obesity
33761137,"The effect of mulberry leaf powder and components on preventing obesity and regulating lipid metabolism were investigated in the present study. The mechanism of action was explored by examining the gut microbiota and lipid metabolism-related signaling pathways. As evidenced by the nutritional obesity rats model experiments, the middle concentration mulberry leaf powder (MLP) group (0.8\u00a0g/kg\u00b7d) significantly reduced Lee's index (25.1, compared with model control group [MC] 25.7) and had the strongest lipid metabolism regulation effect. Furthermore, the suppression effects of different mulberry leaf components on nutritional obesity were compared and the mulberry leaf phenolics and fiber mixture (Mulberry leaf mixture [MLM]) group (0.6\u00a0g/kg\u00b7d) was found to have the strongest efficacy (body weight [BW] reduced 12.4%). Real time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses demonstrated that MLP (0.8\u00a0g/kg\u00b7d) and its components inhibited adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride synthesis through the PPAR-\u03b3- C/EBP-\u03b1 signaling pathway, resulting in lipid metabolism regulation. Gut microbiota analysis indicated that MLM (0.6\u00a0g/kg\u00b7d) prevented the reduction in intestinal flora diversity (reach 491 species) caused by high-energy feed, and reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (to 7.99%) and the obesity associated flora, Lachnospiraceae (to 19.1%), whereas it improved the content of the beneficial flora, Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus_johnsonii (reach 11.77%). MLM improved the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of the two functional components (phenolics and fiber) and maximized the anti-obesity effect through the gut microbiota-host metabolism pathway.

33682095,"The prevalence, healthcare and socio-economic impact of obesity (defined as having a body mass index of \u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg.m<sup>-2</sup> ) are disproportionately higher in women than men. A combination of biological and social factors, including the adaptation of energy homeostasis to the increased demands of pregnancy and lactation and poor access to healthy foods or exercise facilities, contribute to the increasing prevalence of obesity in women. Obesity-related physiological changes stem from mass loading and increased metabolism of adipose tissue, as well as secretion of bioactive substances from adipocytes leading to chronic low-grade inflammation. As a result, obesity is associated with increased risks of: infertility; malignancy; sleep-disordered breathing; cardiovascular disease; diabetes; and thromboembolism. Hence, obese women are at markedly increased risk of peri-operative morbidity and mortality and require comprehensive evaluation and targeted comorbidity optimisation by a multidisciplinary team. In addition to routine obstetric challenges, pregnancy in women with obesity further exacerbates the above risks, making multidisciplinary management starting at pre-conception even more important. Weight loss, lifestyle management and optimisation of comorbidity are the cornerstone of reducing obesity-related risks. The anaesthetist plays a vital role within the multidisciplinary team by emphasising weight loss as part of pre-operative comorbidity optimisation, formulation of individualised peri-operative management plans, supervising postoperative care in the high dependency or intensive care settings and providing safe labour analgesia and careful peripartum management for obese parturients.",Obesity

Considering the ability of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) to modulate the cortical excitability, the reward system, and, indirectly, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), we hypothesized a potential role of dTMS in affecting the brain-gut communication pathways, and the gut microbiota composition in obesity. In a hospital setting, 22 subjects with obesity (5 M, 17 F; 44.9 \u00b1 2.2 years; BMI 37.5 \u00b1 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomized into three groups receiving 15 sessions (3 per week for 5 weeks) of high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF) dTMS, or sham stimulation. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 5 weeks of treatment. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Italy) and analyzed by a metagenomics approach (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine). After 5 weeks, a significant weight loss was found in HF (HF: -4.1 \u00b1 0.8%, LF: -1.9 \u00b1 0.8%, sham: -1.3 \u00b1 0.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.042) compared to LF and sham groups, associated with a decrease in norepinephrine compared to baseline (HF: -61.5 \u00b1 15.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.01; LF: -31.8 \u00b1 17.1%, <i>p</i> < 0.05; sham: -35.8 \u00b1 21.0%, <i>p</i> > 0.05).

33946540,"Overweight and obesity are key risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity is currently presented as a pro-inflammatory state with an expansion in the outflow of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), alongside the expanded emission of leptin. The present review aimed to evaluate the relationship between obesity and inflammation and their impacts on the development of cardiovascular disease. A literature search was conducted by employing three academic databases, namely PubMed (Medline), Scopus (EMBASE), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The search presented 786 items, and by inclusion and exclusion filterers, 59 works were considered for final review. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) method was adopted to conduct quality assessment; 19 papers were further selected based on the quality score. Obesity-related inflammation leads to a low-grade inflammatory state in organisms by upregulating pro-inflammatory markers and downregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Because of inflammatory and infectious symptoms, adipocytes appear to instigate articulation and discharge a few intense stage reactants and carriers of inflammation. Obesity and inflammatory markers are strongly associated, and are important factors in the development of CVD. Hence, weight management can help prevent cardiovascular risks and poor outcomes by inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms.",Obesity

33922998,"The prevalence of obesity continues to rise worldwide despite evidence-based public health recommendations. The promise to adopt a healthy lifestyle is increasingly important for tackling this global epidemic. Calorie restriction or regular exercise or a combination of the two is accepted as an effective strategy in preventing or treating obesity. Furthermore, the benefits conferred by regular exercise to overcome obesity are attributed not only to reduced adiposity or reduced levels of circulating lipids but also to the proteins, peptides, enzymes, and metabolites that are released from contracting skeletal muscle or other organs. The secretion of these molecules called cytokines in response to exercise induces browning of white adipose tissue by increasing the expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes within the white adipose tissue, suggesting that exercise-induced cytokines may play a significant role in preventing obesity. In this review, we present research-based evidence supporting the effects of exercise and various diet interventions on preventing obesity and adipose tissue health. We also discuss the interplay between adipose tissue and the cytokines secreted from skeletal muscle and other organs that are known to affect adipose tissue and metabolism.",Obesity
33920604,"Emerging data suggest that obesity is a major risk factor for the progression of major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group. We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications. First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others. Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm. Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage. In this review we first summarize clinical findings on the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 disease severity and then further discuss potential mechanisms that could explain the risk for major complications in patients suffering from obesity.",Obesity

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin treatment on the body fat accumulation, lipid profiles, and circulating irisin of rats with high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO). Methods: 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups and treated for 8 weeks: vehicle control (VC), positive control (PC), MEL10 (10 mg melatonin/kg body weight (BW)), MEL20 (20 mg/kg BW), and MEL50 (50 mg/kg BW). The vehicle control group was fed a control diet, and the other groups were fed a high-fat and high-calorie diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity before the melatonin treatment began. Melatonin reduced weight gain without affecting the food intake, reduced the serum total cholesterol level, enhanced the fecal cholesterol excretion, and increased the circulating irisin level. Melatonin downregulated the fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expressions of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and induced the browning of iWAT in both the MEL10 and MEL20 groups.

33804765,"The recent pandemic Sars-CoV2 infection and studies on previous influenza epidemic have drawn attention to the association between the obesity and infectious diseases susceptibility and worse outcome. Metabolic complications, nutritional aspects, physical inactivity, and a chronic unbalance in the hormonal and adipocytokine microenvironment are major determinants in the severity of viral infections in obesity. By these pleiotropic mechanisms obesity impairs immune surveillance and the higher leptin concentrations produced by adipose tissue and that characterize obesity substantially contribute to such immune response dysregulation. Indeed, leptin not only controls energy balance and body weight, but also plays a regulatory role in the interplay between energy metabolism and immune system. Since leptin receptor is expressed throughout the immune system, leptin may exert effects on cells of both innate and adaptive immune system. Chronic inflammatory states due to metabolic (i.e., obesity) as well as infectious diseases increase leptin concentrations and consequently lead to leptin resistance further fueling inflammation. Multiple factors, including inflammation and ER stress, contribute to leptin resistance. Thus, if leptin is recognized as one of the adipokines responsible for the low grade inflammation found in obesity, on the other hand, impairments of leptin signaling due to leptin resistance appear to blunt the immunologic effects of leptin and possibly contribute to impaired vaccine-induced immune responses. However, many aspects concerning leptin interactions with inflammation and immune system as well as the therapeutical approaches to overcome leptin resistance and reduced vaccine effectiveness in obesity remain a challenge for future research.",Obesity
33804729,"Obesity or overweight are not superficial problems, constituting a pressing issue. The obesity index has almost tripled since 1975, which is an alarming state. Most of the individuals are currently becoming overweight or have inappropriate body mass index (BMI) conditions. Obesity is characterized by increased fat accumulation and thus poses a higher health risk. There is increased size and volume of fat cells in the body, which usually accounts for obesity. Many investigations have been carried out in this area, such as behavioral improvements, dietary changes, chemical involvements, etc., but presently no such goals are established to manage these health concerns. Based on previous literature reports and our interpretation, the current review indicates the involvement of various transcriptional and transporter functions in modifying the above-mentioned health conditions. Various transcriptional factors such as Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) impart a significant effect on the physiology and pathology of metabolic dysfunction such as obesity. FoxO1 plays a dual role whether in the progression or suppression of metabolic processes depending on its targets. Thus, in the current study, will be discussed the dual role of FoxO1 in metabolic conditions (such as obesity), also summarizing the role of various other transcriptional factors involved in obesity.",Obesity

Data collected in regard to etiological sustaining of obesity, has revealed hypothesized energy misbalance and neuro-humoral dysfunction, which is stimulated by autophagy. Autophagy regulates chief salvaging events for protein clustering, excessive triglycerides, and impaired mitochondria which is accompanied by oxidative and genotoxic stress in mammals. Autophagy is a homeostatic event, which regulates biological process by eliminating lethal cells and reprocessing physiological constituents, comprising of proteins and fat. Unquestionably, autophagy impairment is involved in metabolic syndromes, like obesity. According to an individual's metabolic outline, autophagy activation is essential for metabolism and activity of the adipose tissue and to retard metabolic syndrome i.e. obesity. The manuscript summarizes the perception of current knowledge on autophagy stimulation and its effect on the obesity.",Obesity

Most patients do not experience severe complications, but approximately 25% of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the mortality rate is approximately 5-7%. Clinical findings have determined several risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19 patients, such as advanced age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases. Obesity is a common and serious health problem worldwide that initiates a cascade of disorders, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of these disorders is linked to a more severe course of COVID-19.

The molecular mechanisms underlying physiological adaptation to physical activity are not fully understood. It has been documented that both intracellular and extracellular (circulating) microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in both obesogenic and exercise adaptation mechanisms. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of publications that examined the effect of exercise on the expression of miRNAs in individuals with obesity. In addition, bioinformatics analysis was performed on most repetitive miRNAs. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched with relevant keywords. We only included studies that utilized exercise as a modality for the health management of human subjects with obesity to evaluate the changes in expression of obesity-related miRNAs. Through checking of 211 retrieved articles, we reached 12 eligible studies. Some studies reported a statistically significant correlation between the change of miRNAs and clinical parameters such as body mass index and fasting glucose. In silico analysis of most repetitive miRNAs i.e. miR-126, miR-21, miR-146a, miR-221, and miR-223 resulted in the molecular signaling pathways that potentially involve in cellular adaption to exercise in people with obesity. miRNAs partake in health-related benefits of physical activity on obesity-associated cellular and molecular phenomena.

For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the association between obesity and severity or prognosis requires further analysis. <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective, single-center study. Hospitalized patients were recruited in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2, 2020 to February 20, 2020. The data of body mass index (BMI) was obtained from follow-up of surviving patients. According to BMI, normal weight was defined as 18.5-23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and obesity as > 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. <b>Results:</b> A total of 463 patients were enrolled, of which 242 (52.3%) patients were in the normal weight group; 179 (38.7%) were in the overweight group; and 42 (9.1%) were in the obesity group. Compared to the normal group, obese patients were more likely to have a higher heart rate; lower finger oxygen saturation; higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophil counts, basophil counts, intravenous glucose, triacylglycerol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase-MB, CD19+ cell counts and percentage; and lower levels of monocyte percentage, high density lipoprotein and CD3+ cell percentage. In addition, the proportions of hypertension (21.5% vs. 42.6%) and severe+critical illness (47.8 vs. 81.0 %) were significantly higher in the obesity group than those in normal group. However, no significant differences were observed between the normal and obesity groups in critical illness, organ damage and defined endpoint (mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit). Multiple logistic regression showed that obesity increased the risk of developing severe+critical illness (Odd ratio 3.586, 95% CI 1.550-8.298, P=0.003) in patients with COVID-19, and did not affect the risk of critical illness, organ damage and endpoints.

33673390,"Nutrition transition can be defined as shifts in food habits, and it is characterized by high-fat (chiefly saturated animal fat), hypercaloric and salty food consumption at the expense of dietary fibers, minerals and vitamins. Western dietary patterns serve as a model for studying the impact of nutrition transition on civilization diseases, such as obesity, which is commonly associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. In fact, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction can be associated with nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated inflammation in obesity. NF-\u03baB regulates gene expression of several oxidant-responsive adipokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis and in modulation of metabolic inflammation, can be downregulated by I\u03baB kinase (IKK)-dependent TNF-\u03b1 activation. On the other hand, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet is highly encouraged because of its healthy dietary pattern, which includes antioxidant nutraceuticals such as polyphenols. Indeed, hydroxycinnamic derivatives, quercetin, resveratrol, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, which are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, exert anti-obesity proprieties. In this review, we highlight the impact of the most common polyphenols from Mediterranean foods on molecular mechanisms that mediate obesity-related oxidative stress and inflammation. Hence, we discuss the effects of these polyphenols on a number of signaling pathways. We note that Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) dietary polyphenols can de-regulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) and NF-\u03baB-mediated oxidative stress, and metabolic inflammation. MedDiet polyphenols are also effective in upregulating downstream effectors of several proteins, chiefly AMPK.",Obesity

More and more CLD patients, even those with liver cirrhosis (LC), tend to be presenting with obesity these days. The annual rate of muscle loss increases with worsening liver reserve, and thus LC patients are more likely to complicate with sarcopenia. LC is also characterized by protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Since the PEM in LC can be invariable, the patients probably present with sarcopenic obesity (Sa-O), which involves both sarcopenia and obesity. Currently, there is no mention of Sa-O in the guidelines; however, the rapidly increasing prevalence and poorer clinical consequences of Sa-O are recognized as an important public health problem, and the diagnostic value of Sa-O is expected to increase in the future. Sa-O involves a complex interplay of physiological mechanisms, including increased inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, hormonal disorders, and decline of physical activity. The pathogenesis of Sa-O in LC is diverse, with a lot of perturbations in the muscle-liver-adipose tissue axis. Here, we overview the current knowledge of Sa-O, especially focusing on LC.",Obesity

General practitioners, other specialists and health care professionals who are treating obese persons require short, summarized, updated and practical guideline. Hungarian medical professionals of different scientific societies, having decennial practices, are summarizing their evidence-based knowledge. Obesity management requires step by step approach, evaluating previously the general health condition, motivation and options of the patients. The measurement of energy requirement, planning of diet and physical activities, available surgical methods and medications are described in detail with life style and mental support needed. The most important period in the prevention of obesity is the first 1000 days from conception. Other significant factors are the life style habits of the parents. Proper obesity prevention requires better coordination of primary health care, community and governmental activities. Obesity should be defined as morbidity, therefore stronger governmental support and more health-policy initiatives are needed, beside increasing number and developing of multidisciplinary centres.

33823179,"COVID-19 was declared an international public health emergency in January, and a pandemic in March of 2020. There are over 125 million confirmed COVID-19 cases that have caused over 2.7 million deaths worldwide as of March 2021. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 presents a surface \""spike\"" protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also infect cells of the oral mucosa, which also express the ACE2 receptor. The spike and ACE2 proteins are highly glycosylated with sialic acid modifications that direct viral-host interactions and infection. Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) has a strong affinity for sialic acid modified proteins and can be used as an antiviral agent. Here, we report that MASL targets the ACE2 receptor, decreases ACE2 expression and glycosylation, suppresses binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and decreases expression of inflammatory mediators by oral epithelial cells that cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we report that MASL also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney epithelial cells in culture. This work identifies MASL as an agent with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes.",COVID

33582450,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, is reported to increase the rate of mortality worldwide. COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory symptoms as well as blood coagulation in the vessels (thrombosis), heart attack and stroke. Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID-19 patients and virus-induced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin-13, dynorphin-13, and products such as angiotensin (1-7), angiotensin (1-9), apelin-12, dynorphin-12 in the human body. Substrates accumulation ultimately induces inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, neuronal and tissue damage while diminished products lead to the loss of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic responses. In this review, we focus on the viral-induced imbalance between ACE2 substrates and products which exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Considering the roadmap, we propose multiple therapeutic strategies aiming to rebalance the products of ACE2 and to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease.",COVID

33865882,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, with variable presentations of different organ systems. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable ranging from mild presentations to severe, life-threatening symptoms and the wide individual variability may be due to the broad heterogeneity in the underlying pathologies. There is no doubt that early management may have a major influence on the outcome. This led the scientists to search for ways to monitor disease progression or to predict outcomes in COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to predict who will progress to the severe forms or in what time, numerous prospective and longitudinal studies represent the evidence for determining the potential immunological risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death. The kinetics and breadth of immune responses during COVID-19 appear to follow a trend which is consistent to the predominant pathological alterations. Recent publications have used these biomarkers to help identify patients who will develop the severe acute COVID-19. Of particular interest is the relationship between the kinetics of peripheral leukocytes and clinical progress of the disease in COVID-19.

With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking.

Methods and Results COVID MECH (COVID-19 Mechanisms) was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 patients (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60\u00b115\u00a0(mean \u00b1 SD) years, 71 (58%) were men, 68 (55%) were White, and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently men, had more diabetes mellitus, and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin (all <0.001), but comparable levels of cTnT (cardiac troponin T; <i>P</i>=0.09), NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; <i>P</i>=0.27) and D-dimer (<i>P</i>=0.67) to patients without viremia.

33515984,"The association of mortality with the early humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection within the first few days after onset of symptoms (DAOS) has not been thoroughly investigated partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive antibody testing methods. Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with mortality.",COVID

33917858,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Sentinel surveillance in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico represented a significant cost reduction and was useful in estimating the population infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. <i>Results</i>: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; <i>p</i> < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions</i>: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients. A high percentage of the participants in the study (61.85%) did not meet the operational definition for a suspected case of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus, representing a high percentage of the population that could have remained without a COVID-19 diagnosis, so becoming a potential source of virus spread.",COVID

However, it is not entirely clear to what extent natural SARS-CoV-2 infection of pet dogs and cats is in households. We have developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and the SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neutralization assay to screen serum samples of 239 pet cats and 510 pet dogs in Minnesota in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-April to early June 2020 for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposures. A cutoff value was used to identify the seropositive samples in each experiment. The average seroprevalence of N- and RBD-specific antibodies in pet cats were 8% and 3%, respectively. Among nineteen (19) N-seropositive cat sera, fifteen (15) exhibited neutralizing activity and seven (7) were also RBD-seropositive. The N-based ELISA is also specific and does not cross react with antigens of common feline coronaviruses. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at a very low percentage in pet dogs (~ 1%) and were limited to IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2\u00a0N protein with no neutralizing activities.

34014840,"BACKGROUNDThe significant risks posed to mothers and fetuses by COVID-19 in pregnancy have sparked a worldwide debate surrounding the pros and cons of antenatal SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, as we lack sufficient evidence regarding vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women and their offspring. We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection.METHODSA multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to 3 study groups: vaccinated (n = 86); PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n = 65), and unvaccinated noninfected controls (n = 62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using the Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD, and N).RESULTSThe BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer ratio at birth was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared with second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.CONCLUSIONAntenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.FUNDINGIsrael Science Foundation and the Weizmann Institute Fondazione Henry Krenter.",COVID

In addition, we provide evidence in patients with COVID-19 that SARS-CoV-2 is massively detected and replicated within the multiciliated cells. We observed these findings during the early stage of COVID-19, when infected ciliated cells were rapidly replaced by differentiating precursor cells.

As a result, hospitals must effectively decontaminate and contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in constructed and deconstructed ICUs that care for patients with COVID-19. We assessed decontamination of a COVID-19 ICU and examined the containment efficacy of combined contact and droplet precautions in creating and maintaining a SARS-CoV-2-negative ICU \""antechamber\"". <b>Methods:</b> To examine the efficacy of chemical decontamination, we used high-density, semi-quantitative environmental sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces in a COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure viral RNA on surfaces. Viral location mapping revealed the distribution of viral RNA in the COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Results were further assessed using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. <b>Results:</b> We collected 224 surface samples pre-decontamination and 193 samples post-decontamination from a COVID-19 ICU and adjoining COVID-19 ICU antechamber. We found that 46% of antechamber objects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 pre-decontamination despite the construction of a swinging door barrier system, implementation of contact precautions, and installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters. The object positivity rate reduced to 32.1% and viral particle rate reduced by 95.4% following decontamination.

While chemical decontamination effectively removes detectable viral RNA from surfaces, our approach to droplet/contact containment with an antechamber was not highly effective. These data suggest that hospitals should plan for the potential of aerosolized virions when creating strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2.",COVID

33807957,"Although antibody levels progressively decrease following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune memory persists for months. Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than na\u00efve individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in na\u00efve subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response.",COVID
33767706,"As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, it is imperative to learn more about antibodies and T-cells produced against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, in order to guide the rapid development of therapies and vaccines. While much of the current antibody and vaccine research focuses on the receptor-binding domain of S1, a less-recognized opportunity is to harness the potential benefits of the more conserved S2 subunit. Similarities between the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 warrant exploring S2. Possible benefits of employing S2 in therapies and vaccines include the structural conservation of S2, extant cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in populations (due to prior exposure to common cold coronaviruses), the steric neutralization potential of antibodies against S2, and the stronger memory B-cell and T-cell responses. More research is necessary on the effect of glycans on the accessibility and stability of S2, SARS-CoV-2 mutants that may affect infectivity, the neutralization potential of antibodies produced by memory B-cells, cross-reactive T-cell responses, antibody-dependent enhancement, and antigen competition. This perspective aims to highlight the evidence for the potential advantages of using S2 as a target of therapy or vaccine design.",COVID

In a short span of time, COVID-19 has sacked more than one million human lives and marked as a severe global pandemic, which is drastically accountable for the adverse effect directly to the human society, particularly the health care system and the economy. The unavailability of approved and effective drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 further created conditions more adverse and terrifying. To win the war against this pandemic within time there is a desperate need for the most adequate therapeutic treatment, which can be achieved by the collaborative research work among scientists worldwide. In continuation of our efforts to support the scientific community, a review has been presented which discusses the structure and the activity of numerous molecules exhibiting promising SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs inhibition activities. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of the structure, a plausible mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and crucial structural features substantial to inhibit the primary virus-based and host-based targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 treatment.

33483313,"Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 million inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during, and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41\u2009days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.",COVID
33296851,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) stand at the frontline for fighting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%. Of the serology positive samples, 100 samples were further tested using the SAS2pp neutralization assay; 92 (92%) samples showed neutralization activity. The seropositivity rate in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is low and varies across different regions with higher positivity in case-hospitals than control-hospitals. The lack of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 8% of the tested samples could mean that assay is a more sensitive assay or that neutralization assay has a lower detection limits; or possibly that some samples had cross-reaction to spike protein of other coronaviruses in the assay, but these were not specific to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",COVID

Geographic variation in itself is associated with both case severity and allelic variation especially in strains from Indian origin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000001). Using an new alternative bioinformatics approach we were able to confirm that the presence of the D614G mutation correlates with increased case severity in a sample of 127 sequences from a shared geographic origin in the US (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). While leaving open the question on the pathogenesis mechanism involved, this suggests that in specific geographic locales certain genotypes of the virus are more pathogenic than others.

We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, were associated with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity, and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB coinfection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1-mediated CD4+ T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression.

As such, considerable uncertainty remains regarding whether human milk is capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child. Here, we report that repeated milk samples collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis did not contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, we found that milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity.

While subunit vaccines are one of the prominent options for combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes. This finding indicates that expression systems with posttranslational modification abilities are important to maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19 vaccines.

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease.

34067349,"Europe is experiencing a third wave of COVID-19 due to the spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. A number of positive and negative factors constantly shape the rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalization, and mortality. Among these factors, the rise in increasingly transmissible variants on one side and the effect of vaccinations on the other side create a picture deeply different from that of the first pandemic wave. Starting from the observation that in several European countries the number of COVID-19 infections in the second and third pandemic wave increased without a proportional rise in disease severity and mortality, we hypothesize the existence of an additional factor influencing SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. This factor consists of an immune defence against severe COVID-19, provided by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells progressively developing upon natural exposure to low virus doses present in populated environments. As suggested by recent studies, low-dose viral particles entering the respiratory and intestinal tracts may be able to induce T cell memory in the absence of inflammation, potentially resulting in different degrees of immunization. In this scenario, non-pharmaceutical interventions would play a double role, one in the short term by reducing the detrimental spreading of SARS-CoV-2 particles, and one in the long term by allowing the development of a widespread (although heterogeneous and uncontrollable) form of immune protection.",COVID

IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay.RESULTSOverall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months.CONCLUSIONQuantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases.

It is important to predict the prostate's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and the disease outcome by assessing TMPRSS2 expression in cancer tissues. In this study, we conducted the expression profiles of the TMPRSS2 gene for COVID-19 in different normal tissues and PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumour tissues. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in normal tissues including the small intestine, prostate, pancreas, salivary gland, colon, stomach, seminal vesicle and lung, and is increased in PRAD tissues, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might attack not only the lungs and other normal organs, but also in PRAD cancer tissues. Hypomethylation of TMPRSS2 promoter may not be the mechanism for TMPRSS2 overexpression in PRAD tissues and PRAD pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 expresses eleven isoforms in PRAD tissues, with the TMPRSS2-001 isoform expressed highest and followed by TMPRSS2-201. Further isoform structures prediction showed that these two highly expressed isoforms have both SRCR_2 and Trypsin (Tryp_SPc) domains, which may be essential for TMPRSS2 functional roles for tumorigenesis and entry for SARS-CoV-2 in PRAD patients.

33137851,"The outbreak of COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 rapidly spread across the globe and has become pandemic. Little is known about the protective factors of this infection, which is equally distributed between genders and different ages while severe and poor prognosis cases are strongly associated to old males and the presence of comorbidities. Thus, preventive measures aiming at reducing the number of infection and/or their severity are strongly needed. Vitamin D has got great attention and has been claimed as potentially protective against the infection since it may be associated with immunocompetence, inflammation, aging, and those diseases involved in determining the outcomes of COVID-19. This narrative review aims at collecting the literature available on the involvement of the vitamin D status in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the putative utility of vitamin D supplementation in the therapeutics. It emerges that a poor vitamin D status seems to associate with an increased risk of infection whereas age, gender and comorbidities seem to play a more important role in COVID-19 severity and mortality. While randomized control trials are needed to better inquire into this topic, vitamin D supplementation may be useful beside its potential effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.",COVID

33545551,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging human health worldwide. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been promptly applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 owing to its high amplification efficacy and less requirement of the thermal cycler. However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a transilluminator within 50\u00a0min, providing a convenient reporting manner under the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously.

33920908,"We aimed to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised of four rapid online focus groups conducted at a higher education institution in England, during high alert (tier 2) national COVID-19 restrictions. Participants were purposively sampled university students (<i>n =</i> 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services.",COVID
